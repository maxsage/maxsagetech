    What Is Vue.js? </h2>

      Introduction </h3>
      <p>
        Hello and welcome to Vue. js: Big Picture. I'm Daniel Stern, also known as the Code Whisperer, and throughout
        this short course, I'll be walking you through everything that you need to know to become a Vue expert. While we
        won't be diving into detail in any of these topics, this will give you the context you need to pursue a full Vue
        education if you decide it's something you're interested in. Don't forget, if you want to get in touch, you can
        follow me on Twitter @danieljackstern. So what will we be discussing throughout this course? First, we'll
        understand exactly what Vue is, and we'll learn if it can help your business achieve its goals, whatever they
        may be. We'll get an overview of the core features that Vue developers have to know. We're not actually going to
        learn the ins and outs of all these features, but we will learn what they are. We'll also learn about the
        specific challenges Vue can help you solve. So if you have a particular coding problem down at the workplace,
        we'll learn if Vue is something that could help you with that or if not. In addition, we'll try to understand
        Vue relative to frameworks that we might already be familiar with. We'll compare it to a couple of frameworks
        like React and Angular and gain a bit more context on what it's all about. Finally, I'll advise you on some
        further resources that I think would be great for you to continue learning more about Vue when you complete this
        short course. In the next clip, we'll discuss the process of creating business solutions using Vue.

      Creating Business Solutions with Vue.js </h3>
      <p>
        I decided to begin this course not by discussing the technical aspects of Vue, but by discussing the business
        aspects. Can is solve the problems that your business has? Can through it solving those problems increase the
        revenue that your business earns? If it can increase the revenue of the business you own or work at, then
        there's a good argument that spending time to learn it and master it is not just fun and interesting, but a
        valuable way to spend time and a valuable skill to learn. In this chart, the pie represents the total amount of
        commerce going through two different channels, Native App and Desktop &amp; Mobile. As we can see, the purple
        part, or the subset of the market where Vue is useful, is the one we're interested in. This chart shows us that
        of all the e-commerce being done, applications where Vue can get involved form a very large, in fact, a majority
        chunk of those. Currently, VUE doesn't have any use in the Native App domain. But in the future, Vue could have
        its own solution similar to React Native. Moreover, let's look at this quote from eMarketer. They said, "In
        2017, retail e-commerce sales worldwide reached $2. 304 trillion. " And they also note that that's almost a 25%
        increase from the previous year. In other words, the data shows that there is, in fact, a very large amount of
        commerce going through the net and also through desktop applications like the kind that we make through Vue. But
        how does Vue interrelate to these e-commerce situations? So first of all, Vue apps can be built quickly, as
        we'll see, and the teams that build them don't have to be total experts. Of course, skill is good, but we'll
        also discuss that the skill level required to use Vue is fairly low compared to its rivals. In addition, Vue
        performs very quickly, and the package that Vue comes in, the library, is quite small. So when a user accesses
        your website on a mobile device, if it's not fast or if the library doesn't download fast enough, then it just
        won't work, and you won't make any money. Lastly, you can look at Vue as a toolset that contains everything you
        need to build the view layer for your application. So if you've built an application that sells widgets, and all
        the database stuff is taken care of, you're ready to go out there and sell it, Vue is everything you need to
        connect what the user sees to those back-end processes that makes the e-commerce happen. Finally, let's say you
        decide not to use a Vue. Maybe you use a different library or an ad-hoc solution of your own, maybe you just
        stick with good old-fashioned PHP and Java, what are the costs of that? So as we discussed, if your page is too
        slow or the payload too big, mobile users will navigate away before anything has even loaded. You won't even
        have a chance to make your pitch, and there's data that supports this trend of the low, short attention span of
        these mobile users. So every time your framework of choice takes too long to load, you lose a potential sale.
        Vue is not perfect, but it is by far the smallest of the three frameworks, and thus loads the fastest. Next,
        drawing lists when you're dealing the DOM, or a Document Object Model, is a very expensive, slow operation. On
        mobile, redrawing a list that say has 10 or 12 elements can be so slow that the page can freeze altogether. Vue,
        similar to React and to Angular, uses what's called a virtual DOM. So when you update your list of 12 items, the
        actual change that happens to the DOM is minimized and it puts the least stress on the mobile device. Finally,
        let's say you're still using your existing ad-hoc solution. Let's just imagine it's a PHP application that's
        been developed for the past 10 years. When you want to make a change to the view layer if it's not made in an
        organized way or using a tool that I recommend, such as Vue, it may be disorganized and developers will take a
        long time to fix it. They will probably fix it eventually, but if there's a lot of disjointed code, then the
        result is it simply takes longer to deal with. Developer hours are very expensive, so if your developers are
        taking a long time to fix these Vue situations, it's going to affect the bottom line of your business. So I hope
        I've explained all the reasons why Vue can make sense for you accomplishing your business goals, whether it's to
        sell a product, or to share information, or simply to make a faster, better site to show off your own skills.
        Vue can definitely help you do it. Now the question you may have on your mind is why Vue? Why not something
        else? And that's a great question. We'll discuss that in the next clip.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div><h3 class="course-transcript__clip-header">
      Why Vue? </h3>
      <p>
        So, why Vue? Why not a different framework? Why not anything? It's a fair question. And in addition to knowing
        the answer, if you, for example, suggest to your manager or your supervisor that you want to use Vue for a
        particular task, it would be very useful if you could explain why Vue yourself. As the Bard once penned, "Some
        are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust up them. " Well folks, you might say that
        React was born great, Angular achieved greatness, and Vue had greatness thrust upon it. In the past, if you had
        a website problem that needed to be solved, something involving the view layer, something the user sees or
        clicked on, you'd probably reach for one of these libraries, jQuery, Angular, or React, and no one could blame
        you because they've been the standards for at least a decade. But now you may want to consider throwing that all
        out because Vue may, in fact, solve these problems better. So why would you use Vue? So first, and this is a big
        selling point, at least in my mind, Vue works for new or existing applications. If you have a new application
        that you're just getting started on, great, Vue works. But if you have an existing application, PHP, Angular,
        React, jQuery, you name it, you can start using Vue right away by targeting particular parts of the application
        that you want. In other words, Vue is not only useful for starting a brand-new application from scratch, it can
        be used to patch or improve applications you already have. Next, despite being a very new library, Vue is
        replete with features that are familiar to React and Angular developers. It's actually kind of interesting
        because Vue seems to combine a little bit of both. It has the virtual DOM of React with familiar directives of
        Angular, so no matter what your developer's background is, they're going to be able to apply at least a bit of
        their previous knowledge in working with Vue, and their learning process should be quite a bit faster. Another
        thing about Vue is, well, it's simple. Writing a Vue application feels just a bit simpler and easier than
        writing a React or Angular application. Thus, when a developer is tasked with fixing or upgrading a part of the
        application, the code that's written can be easily understood and the necessary fixes can be done fairly
        quickly. If you use Vue properly, you'll end up with an application where the component's logic, as well as its
        view and its connection to the overall data model are all in one logical place and easily repaired. Finally, Vue
        is popular. It's racked up over 100, 000 stars on GitHub, and I'm sure by the time you're watching this clip,
        it's many, many more. Developers everywhere have thrown out their adulatory stars and declared that they favor
        Vue. In fact, it's difficult to say since these numbers change all the time, but in terms of GitHub stars, Vue
        may be more popular than React or Angular, maybe even more popular than both put together. A popular library is
        likely to have many contributors. Large bugs are likely to be found quickly and addressed promptly. There are
        disadvantages, of course, such as if you want to put forward a pull request or open issue, it may be lost in the
        noise of such a vibrant library. But you can assure your supervisor, your manager, anyone, that Vue is not just
        a fly-by-night library. It's a big deal on the net and supported by some very serious people. Speaking of
        serious people, let's ask the question who uses Vue? Is the kind of team that uses Vue similar at all to your
        team? Well, it probably is. So the first kind of group that can use Vue is a small team or even an individual
        that's creating a prototype or a small application. Vue really shines when you're making prototypes, in other
        words, a small sliver of an application which is interactive, it can have a click or an animation, but can exist
        on its own and doesn't really interact with the back end, at least not seriously. As we'll discover, Vue is very
        good for protypes, and of React, Angular, and Vue, is probably the best at making things that are small. Now if
        you're collaborating on a large web application, then Vue can still be useful. Since Vue breaks up so many parts
        of the view into different components, it makes collaboration easy. That's not to say that you can't use a
        different framework, but in my opinion for new projects that are anywhere between small and large, Vue is the
        best. For projects that are bigger than that like huge or gigantic, then React or Angular might actually make
        more sense. Finally, individual contractors, people from outside of the company that come into fix a particular
        problem, these people really can take advantage of Vue. So as a simple example, let's say you have a very old,
        but profitable e-commerce site, and you want to add a new kind of currency to the checkout page. The checkout
        page is written in PHP, and your current PHP developer tells you that the new currency will take a month to add
        and cost you about $7000. 00. But what can you do? That's just how it's done. Well, you might call in a
        contractor to just replace the whole part of that site with something that can be fixed and updated more cheaply
        and easily. The contractor you'd hire would be very likely to simply take that one part of the page and replace
        it with its own Vue application while keeping the rest of the application intact. Vue is very good for these
        kinds of spot fixes that involve fixing one part of a website without fixing another. Thus, most everyone can
        use Vue given the right circumstances. Now the last thing you're probably wondering is can I use Vue? Do I meet
        the minimum requirements of background knowledge and skill? Well, luckily, you probably do already. So first,
        you'll need a basic knowledge of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Nothing too fancy and certainly much, much, much
        less than you'd need to use React or Angular. But if you don't even know what one of these things is, if you've
        never used HTML before, then you probably need to do a bit of learning before you can tackle Vue. Pluralsight
        has excellent courses on JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, so that's a great place to get started. You need a text
        editor, which is not a big hurdle to get over. I personally prefer WebStorm, but WebStorm costs about $200. 00
        to purchase. Atom is comparable and is free. Both work with Vue. And finally, to work with your Vue application,
        you need some way to get a local server going. You can use a familiar solution like Apache or HTTP server,
        although Vue has its own solution called Vue CLI, which we'll talk about a little bit later. So by now, you
        should have a good idea of why you would use Vue. In the next clip, we'll talk about what Vue is.

      What Is Vue? </h3>
      <p>
        So, what is Vue? It's a funny question actually. I'm sure that a percentage of the audience watching this will
        think that this is a painfully obvious question and do not want to spend any further time discussing it, and I'm
        sure another large segment of the audience is very happy I'm explaining this because it can be a very difficult
        question to answer. What is Vue? Is it an idea, a block of code, a tool? It turns out, it's all these things. So
        if you take away all the metaphor, and symbolism, and context out of Vue, Vue is a JavaScript library. Take a
        little more context out of that, and it's just a big block of JavaScript code. That's what it is. More
        specifically, it's code that you run before any code you write, and it gives context to the code that you write
        by taking words that you type into JavaScript, like Vue, and making those functions instead of just undefined
        words. Now if we looked inside that big block of code that is Vue, we'd see the instructions for making a render
        engine, which is something that takes data as a model, you can imagine it as a JavaScript object, and it outputs
        HTML, which is something that a browser can take and turn into something a user sees. And finally, in a more
        abstract sense, it's a collaboration tool, which allows you to break an application up into smaller segments,
        which lets more than one person work on them. This is done through components. So what are the core features,
        the features that make Vue Vue? Vue has versatile components. If you're not familiar with components, they're
        small, little bundles of JavaScript HTML which can be composed. In other words, you can take a component and put
        it inside another component, and put several components into that one, and they all make this nice, easy
        hierarchy of your application, in theory. Vue's components are simple to use and have all the features that the
        components of React and Angular have minus maybe a few of the more specific ones. Vue also has built-in
        reactivity. Reactivity, which I also like to call magic, is the special quality which causes the application,
        what you see, to update automatically when the data layer changes. Even though you didn't call any calls to
        change the DOM or even tell it to update, it just kind of knows. This is a really cool feature, but as we'll
        learn a little bit later, not without its downsides. As we mentioned, Vue is a small library, it loads quickly,
        and it's designed to render your application fast. No bells, no whistles, just speed. And time and time again,
        we've seen that speed in applications on the web correlates exactly to how much profit you make relative to how
        much profit you could make in a perfect world. Finally, Vue comes with many directives such as for, if, or bind
        prefixed with the word v that anyone who's worked with Angular, or React, or even Knockout will probably be
        familiar with. So let's discuss Vue's proprietary file type called the. vue file. This is a feature that's
        unique to Vue over React and Angular, though they have their own file that you might see only in a React
        project, none of those use the. vue file. That's only a Vue application. So loosely, a. vue file is like a big
        conglomeration of HTML, CSS, and JS, they can all fit in the file together; however, Vue files can't be read by
        web browsers. If you try to open your. vue file in Chrome, it will say that an unrecognized file was opened. So
        you have to have a build step when you choose to use. vue files; otherwise, you don't need to have one. Build
        steps are useful, but also long and confusing. In other words, it's safe to consider a build step as a sacrifice
        you have to make to use. vue files. They're pretty useful though, so some might consider it worth it. The main
        advantage of the. vue file is that it allows all the code for a single component to be in one file, but it
        allows you to do this without writing any pseudocode like, for example, HTML templates in JavaScript or anything
        like that. To help understand, let's look at a sample Vue file. Now a. vue file consists of three sections,
        which I'll explain in a moment. There's the template section, the script section, and the style section. What
        are these sections? So the template section contains HTML. Here you can see a single paragraph tag that I've
        decided is going to be my component. You'll also notice the curly brackets. We can use interpolation, whether
        it's handlebar styles like this or various different kinds of binding, within the template. The script section
        contains the application code. Whatever the module's exports are becomes the controller for the template that
        we've defined above it. Here we're defining the data. And the number 42, if we were to render this component,
        would appear in the message slot above. Finally, the simplest section, styles, contains styles that are scoped
        to this component. So the paragraph that I've colored blue here will only apply to this component and not to
        components or tags that are located outside of this. vue file.. Vue files are fairly simple and easy to use.
        With this initial explanation adding context to your learning, I'm sure you'll find them very useful and simple.
        So now that we understand what Vue is, where can Vue be found? How can we take Vue and put it on our computers
        or in our projects? So first of all, you can find Vue on its GitHub where you can contribute or create issues,
        as well as download the source code. So here I am at the Vue GitHub page, which you can access at the URL at the
        top. This is basically the headquarters for anything and all things Vue. As you can see, since I've started
        making this course, it's already clawed its way up to almost 108, 000 stars, so this is obviously a very
        fast-growing library. Here, if you're interested, you can see the raw source code for Vue. This is a lot for
        anyone except a serious power user to take in, but it's there if you're interested. If you have an issue with
        Vue, like some particular bug you found, you can click the Issues button and create a new issue. You can also
        see the issue discussions that people are having, which is a great way to see into the future of Vue. Last but
        not least, you can just download the Vue source code here by clicking on this and following the instructions.
        Next, you can download the library from a CDN, or a content delivery network, or from npm. So here I am with my
        terminal window open. I've opened it into an empty folder so that when I install these files, I won't put them
        in a directory with a bunch of stuff that's already in it. In order to install Vue this way, you need npm
        installed. If you type npm and don't see any error, then you know you have npm installed. If you do, you can get
        Vue into your project directory just by typing npm install vue, and just like that, it installs. And if I check
        out my directory, node_modules has been created, and if we look inside, Vue has been installed. We're now free
        to use Vue in any application in this directory we want. Finally, you can look at the documentation at vuejs.
        org. The Vue. js documentation is widely applauded by the community as just being some really great
        documentation. You can click the Learn button and get started by reading the Guide. Now if your goal is to go
        beyond anything that's a junior Vue developer, if you want to be intermediate or better, I do recommend that you
        read the Vue documentation and get a good understanding of the total depth of the discussion. There are also
        great courses that are available, which will provide valuable content to help you understand these docs. But at
        the end of the day, the docs are, in a sense, the context, so you should still have a good look at them. So it
        looks like we've answered the question what is a Vue? In the next clip, we'll be discussing what Vue can do and
        also what Vue cannot do.

    Why Use Vue.js? </h2>
    <div><h3 class="course-transcript__clip-header">
      Vue Capabilities and Limitations </h3>
      <p>
        In this clip, we'll be discussing Vue's capabilities and limitations. After all, my goal is not to get you to
        use Vue under any circumstances. I don't get any special reward at the end of the day if you decide to use Vue
        or React. I just honestly do believe that Vue is the best tool for many situations. Many, but not all. So, let's
        have a look. So what are said capabilities and limitations? We'll be looking at what Vue does and what Vue does
        not do. So first, what Vue does. So it outputs HTML code, browsers can read this HTML code, and users see
        something at the end of the day. Simple enough. Vue also, similar to any front-end framework, maps the
        interactions that your user makes, hovering or clicking, to JavaScript methods that you write, which may, for
        example, contact your server and make a payment. Vue does use sophisticated techniques similar to React and
        Angular to speed the rendering of the application. So when you, say, have a list of 20 items and replace them
        with a list of another 20 items, clever substitutions are made so that the device that it's being viewed on
        rerenders as little as possible, and this actually makes a huge difference on slow devices like mobile phones.
        In addition, as long as you don't use the. vue file, Vue works in most browsers, modern browsers, without any
        build step at all. If you're like me and not a huge fan of the extra complexity that build steps bring, you'd
        think this is a very cool feature, especially for protypes or applications with limited scope. Now there's stuff
        that Vue doesn't do. So Vue doesn't create a server for your application. The exception is if you use Vue CLI as
        well since Vue CLI can make a server, but that runs on npm, and we're talking about a whole different stack of
        dependencies, so you may not want to go down that route, in which case you'll need a different solution like
        Apache to actually serve your application. Vue doesn't test your code for errors. You still have to do that
        yourself. If you write code that's wrong, Vue will still try to run it. Unlike Angular, it doesn't have a lot of
        utility methods. There aren't many pipes, and currency converters, and language support built in. It's just Vue.
        You have to use its complimentary library, which we'll be spending quite a bit of time discussing, to give it
        any utility; otherwise, without these libraries, you'd just have to look at it as something that takes a model
        and outputs HTML code. In addition, it doesn't do routing, which is where what the URL in the browser is affects
        what you see. You, once again, need to use a complimentary library, vue-router, to get this working. And unlike
        Angular, Vue does not have its own module solutions, so you're still going to be using ES6 modules for your Vue
        app.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div><h3 class="course-transcript__clip-header">
      Reactivity and Vue </h3>
      <p>
        In this clip, we'll discuss reactivity and Vue. This is an important topic since reactivity is one of the main
        problems that Vue sets out to solve. So what is reactivity? Basically, reactivity is the way an application
        changes what the user sees in response to any kind of activity, for example, the user hitting a button, or
        putting text into an input, or activity coming from the server, like a message that's been sent via AJAX. Here's
        a simple example. Imagine in your application you have a simple array representing a list of your favorite
        fruits. The array contains the items apples and pears. On the right is what a user might see. Now imagine we add
        a new item to this list, let's say grapes. As our data model on the left is updated, we see that our application
        on the right also updates. But why is this all important? So JavaScript doesn't have any built-in solution for
        reactivity. That's why libraries like Vue, Angular, and React exist to fill this gap in the features that
        JavaScript provides automatically. It's a good thing that we have these frameworks too because if not
        implemented correctly, reactivity is very slow, easily the slowest part of any application. Vue solves this
        problem, and moreover, it doesn't solve it in the exact same way as say Angular or React, lending to its
        validity as a possible alternative to those libraries. So when you're working with a Vue application, how should
        you expect it to handle reactivity? So Vue detects the changes to the data automatically, and then what the user
        sees is updated automatically, and they're able to continue interacting with the application. In other words,
        with Vue, reactivity is completely automatic. Compare this to React when, for example, you might need to call
        render in order for your application's view to match its data model. Moreover, Vue reuses DOM elements and also
        uses other special techniques to make the performance of these updates very fast. So we've talked about it in
        theory, but what does this really mean, both for a developer and for a user? First, let's talk about how Vue's
        reactivity relates to a developer. Code is easier to write and maintain since you don't have to explicitly tell
        Vue every time you want to render something. Vue uses a virtual DOM to make large updates fast, and it allows
        you, as a programmer, to express those updates in less code. Since you have less code, it's easier to find and
        fix bugs. But how did this all impact your end user? Well to your end user, the application is fast and fun to
        use. Even if they're working with a huge list, let's say this is a really popular guy, and they have 1000 people
        on their friends list, no matter how big a list, the application doesn't seem to go any slower. Finally, the
        user simply experiences fewer bugs as they're using your application. Pretty good. Unfortunately, reactivity and
        Vue do have some challenges. I find that this is because Vue tries to make everything so automatic that there's
        some situations that arise that are just difficult to resolve. So as we found, Vue components update
        automatically when the underlying data changes. This is really simple if the underlying data is a number, or a
        string, or a Boolean, or an immutable data structure. In JavaScript, the immutable data structures are numbers,
        strings, and Booleans, and the mutable data structures are arrays and objects. And if an array of objects
        represents your data, then reactivity is not so simple. Because of the way modern JavaScript works, Vue's
        automatic detection methods, let's just say they work inconsistently with arrays and objects. Sometimes they're
        able to determine the array has been updated, and sometimes they simply aren't aware, and you're Vue app will
        not update when you expect it to. As you become more experienced with Vue, you will learn techniques that sort
        of indicate to Vue that the data has changed. But I really wanted to warn you about this now, because
        inevitably, if you go deep into Vue, you are going to encounter this challenge where, for example, having an
        object will make your application not work the way that you expect, and now you'll know that the solution
        involves understanding reactivity and mutable objects. In the next clip, we'll jump right into a sample Vue
        application and see how they really work.

      A Simple Vue Application </h3>
      <p>
        I felt that simply talking about Vue without having any kind of Vue application would be too thin of a
        discussion, so I've put together a simple Vue application for us to look at. Now I do mean simple because I
        wanted the application to be fully understandable in under 5 minutes, so I have pulled out all the stops and
        created the simplest thing I could. So we'll be looking at a basic to-do list application. It's you'll take
        things you want to do, you add them to the list, you check them off. It's the most common trope of examples in
        computer programming. As we look at it, you're going to want to take note of the following things. We don't need
        any build step to run our application, the file size is very, very small, and we're using a content delivery
        network to download Vue, which means we don't need npm, and if Vue's already been downloaded by the user from
        the same CDN on a different website, it'll actually load up instantly, which is terrific. So first, let's look
        at the app. The app is available at danielstern. ca/vue, so let's go over there now. I now have my sample Vue
        application open on the left along with the repository, which contains all the code, on the right. So if you'd
        like to get this application running on your own computer, you can install it from the GitHub repository and
        follow the instructions in the Installation section. First, let's have a look at what this application does.
        It's a basic TodoMVC, or to-do Model-View-Controller, application. You can click any of these items, which will
        toggle their completeness, and you can toggle this global Show Completed setting, which will hide or show the
        items that have been completed. Finally, you can add new items. It's not an incredibly complex application, but
        it's a nice microcosm of what we might see in a full-sized production app. Let's look at the code that make all
        this possible. Let's start by looking at index. html. I'm just going to bring this right window up to full size
        so we can see it clearer for a moment. So what we see here at the top is the structure of a normal application.
        We see the title, a link to Bootstrap, and a link to our own styles, which we'll investigate in a minute. The
        first interesting thing we'll run into is this div with the ID app. There's nothing in it, but when a Vue runs,
        you'll define an element that it should kind of bootstrap or put the application into. In this case, the div
        with the ID of app is our such element. The next interesting thing is this script tag. Now Vue has some
        interesting ways of dealing with templates, and one of the ways is that you can put a template inside the HTML
        file. Now this isn't a great way to organize a Vue application if it has more than one component, but in the
        case of my small Vue, TodoMVC, it was just right. So this code inside here is actual Vue template code. First
        you'll notice, on line 26, you'll see this attribute, v-on:click. Vue uses HTML directives similar to Angular to
        coordinate activity. So in this case, v-on:click means that the expression in the quotes afterwards will execute
        whenever the click event occurs. Here, you can see the v-model property on the checkbox. So when I click this
        checkbox here, the property of the model known as showComplete is changing to match whether it's checked or not.
        This code here represents the list of items. Here, we can see a repeater, or an element that repeats itself for
        every item in an array. You can see it uses the v-for directive, which may be familiar to anyone who's used
        Angular as being almost identical to the ngFor directive, and whatever is inside this list item will be repeated
        for every element of the array. Finally, you can see some interpolation. Inside these double curly brackets is a
        statement, a JavaScript statement, that says todo. name. So here where the text of the actual Todo appears is
        directly equivalent to this line of code here. If you're working at home, you can try it by, for example, adding
        the word hello, and you'll see that hello will now appear before each one of these elements. Finally, a form
        allows us to submit a new Todo. Notice this form is using the v-on directive as well, but it's listening to the
        submit event. Finally, at the bottom, you can notice that we're including Vue via a script tag. This means that
        there's no build step and getting our application to actually be a prototype is a bit easier. Next, let's take a
        quick look at our styles. css. As you can see, there's not a whole lot here. Most of the styles are handled by
        bootstrap, which is compatible with Vue. You can see the. completed style, which we are applying conditionally
        to certain elements of our application. Finally, let's look at app. js. Here, on line 11, you can see our data
        model. Our application's data model is literally an array. On line 25, you can see us actually initialize the
        Vue application. This is done with the syntax new Vue. We define an element, as I pointed out, our app element
        in our index file, and our template, which we also had a look at. That's also in the index file. The data method
        returns our application's data model. Here are todos, as well as an empty text string, which will correspond to
        our input here, and the showComplete property. The computed properties of our configurations work in the same
        way as data, but it's data that needs to be processed beforehand. Here you can see the filteredTodos property,
        which is all the todos in the list, but without those that are complete. Computed properties are calculated
        differently than regular properties. The general idea is that they save processing power. Finally, we can see
        the methods that we've defined for our Vue application. There's just one, addTodo, which is called whenever this
        form is submitted. You'll notice all we do is push our new Todo item to the array of todos that we have, and
        then Vue handles the update automatically. This goes back to the reactivity that we're talking about. So that's
        the application. It has some interesting properties. I think it's very cool how declarative our app. js file is
        and how much of the logic we were actually able to put into the template. So that's all the time I have to show
        you this application, but I do encourage you to copy it onto your computer, get it started, and make a few
        changes in the code base to see how each and every line works. So that's all the time I have to discuss this
        simple app I've made, but there's so much more in my comments for you to read and become familiar with. So go
        ahead, clone it, modify it, change the values, add new features, and take some time to get familiar with it.
        After you're satisfied with that, join us again. And in the next clip, we'll be discussing the question of where
        should you use Vue?
      </p>
    </div>
    <div><h3 class="course-transcript__clip-header">
      Where Should You Use Vue? </h3>
      <p>
        As we've seen so far, Vue is a powerful framework with many interesting features, but all front-end challenges
        are not created equal. There are some jobs that Vue just makes more sense for than others, so let's discuss
        that. So what's a good scenario to use Vue in? Well, an off sided and good example is modernizing a legacy
        application, so taking an app that's old and works, but is slow, and maybe isn't compatible with everything you
        want it to be, and bringing it up to modern standards. Additionally, Vue makes it very easy to build
        applications as a team, which we'll discuss in a moment. Finally, Vue is perhaps the best choice out of all the
        major frameworks for the process of prototyping. Let's dive a bit further into these three things. First, let's
        talk about modernizing legacy applications. Legacy applications are extremely common as all an application needs
        to do to become a legacy application is to stick around for 10 or 15 years without breaking; however, these
        older apps tend to be very difficult to upgrade and maintain. So how could we use a Vue to fix this situation?
        So probably the best part is that a Vue can be included incrementally. In other words, you can just replace a
        small part of the application, the most critical part, with a small Vue app. In this scenario, the rest of the
        application will continue to function the same, and you'd go about a process of slowly, but incrementally
        replacing the application with Vue components. In this way, we can also preserve the structure of the existing
        application as we modernize it. This is good because in very old, fragile applications, even the tiniest
        structural change could break the whole thing. Now even if an application is not so old as if it's built with
        React, or Angular, or jQuery, Vue will still be helpful in these situations as it integrates nicely into
        applications that are built with these frameworks. At the end of the day, this is good because using Vue to
        update your legacy application lets you show results right away. As soon as you've fixed a particular problem
        area, you can push the changes, and in that particular area, performance and maintainability will be improved.
        Now you might wonder when is the right time to modernize your application? Well, as William Shakespeare said,
        "Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valiant never taste of death but once. " In other words, the
        longer you wait to modernize your application, the more trouble you're going to have. So here's a quick
        checklist to see if you should modernize your application. First are simple changes, especially just cosmetic
        ones to what the users see. Do those changes take a long time? And are they so unusually complicated that for
        some reason only your most senior and experienced developers can handle them? When the boss of the company
        requests a new feature in the view layer, do the senior developers say that they simply cannot do it because
        implementing it would be too hard or it might break something else? Do you hear this a lot while working on your
        project? Finally, is the code of the application all ad hoc? In other words, is there no guiding principle or
        unifying strategy that ties the whole application together? If it is, then when you have a new developer coming
        in, they're going to have to relearn everything from the ground up, whereas if you use something like Vue, new
        recruits are usually already familiar with the conventions used in React, Angular, and Vue.
      </p>

    <div><h3 class="course-transcript__clip-header">
      Building Applications as a Team and Prototyping with Vue </h3>
      <p>
        The next area where it makes sense to use Vue is when you have a team and you're all building an application
        together. Now I know that you can also use React and Angular for this purpose, but we'll be comparing React and
        Angular directly to Vue a bit later. So for now, let's just look at Vue's benefits specifically when we're
        working with a team. So the main feature of Vue, as we've seen, is components, and components allow us to
        separate the different parts of our app into different bodies of work. This makes it easy for two different
        developers to work on two different parts of the app. In addition,. vue files give us a convenient way to
        separate our CSS, our HTML, and our JavaScript, but keep them in the same file. As the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
        can't be mixed, but have to be in their own distinct part of the Vue file, it makes it easy to check these
        changes in with source control and multiple different developers can work on the same Vue file. Another
        advantage, which I've pointed out, is that a lot of people, and this proportion of people is growing every day,
        are already familiar with Vue. By the time you're done with this course, you'll be somewhat familiar with Vue as
        well. Thus, if you've been building an extremely by the books Vue app and you bring someone else in, they should
        be able to jump in with minimal assistance. Very cool. Finally, when it comes time for your application to
        really evolve and become a big, full-featured application, the ecosystem that Vue has, the accompanying
        libraries, provide the tooling that you need to make it happen. So as we'll discuss later, you can use Vue's
        ecosystem libraries to facilitate routing, or state management, or all the bigger challenges that you're going
        to face when you build this app. Finally, let's talk about prototyping. I've saved the best for last because
        prototyping is really where Vue shines above React and Angular. So Vue can be set up very quickly. If you go
        with the most basic setup, as in using the Vue script from a CDN, then there's basically no set up at all. You
        can get started 5 minutes after your supervisor or boss has requested the prototype. But even in a prototype,
        Vue is still fast. So if your prototype involves say a list of 100 elements or 1000 elements, if you just wrote
        it in plain HTML or jQuery, you'd probably get a bit of slowdown, especially on slower devices, but Vue can
        create prototypes that are still really fast. They feel snappy. Finally, there's not a big difference between
        how you'd make a Vue prototype and how you'd make a real Vue app. Thus, if your prototype is a hit, it's very
        simple to take that prototype and turn it into a full application or compose it into your existing Vue
        components. So those are all the things you can do with Vue. As you can see, the list is not short, and it's a
        very useful library. In the next clip, we'll be discussing the Vue ecosystem, or those libraries that let you do
        things that with just Vue you cannot.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="course-transcript__module"><h2 class="course-transcript__module-header">
    The Vue Ecosystem </h2>
    <div><h3 class="course-transcript__clip-header">
      The Vue Ecosystem </h3>
      <p>
        We'll now be talking about the Vue ecosystem. The libraries we'll be talking about here are separate from Vue.
        They're a sperate npm install and they have their own maintainers; however, they're designed to work with Vue
        and let us do things that we couldn't do if we only had Vue. js. So what is the so called Vue ecosystem? Well,
        Vue is a small library. It's small because it only has its core features, the features that let you quickly
        render your application's Vue. In a sense, this is good, especially as we'll see soon when we compare the file
        size to React and Angular; however, there's a caveat. To achieve the same functionality as React or Angular, and
        I should point out that they also have their own large, distinct, unique ecosystems, you have to use other
        libraries together with Vue. So what are some of these libraries that you might use? Now I want to qualify this
        by saying that I'm just going to do a bird's eye view of these libraries. Rest assured many of these could have
        and entire course written on them, the length of which far exceeds this course. Hopefully in the future, I'll
        have a chance to share that course with you, but for now use this as an opportunity to gain context, to
        understand more what you'd like to learn about next. So one complimentary library is called Nuxt, and it's used
        for universal rendering. In other words, you use it to speed up the rendering of your application by having the
        server do a lot of work. It's a complicated process to do manually, but Nuxt tries to make it simple. Next is
        Vuex. Vuex is like Redux, and it's used for state management. So if you have a really big app and it has a lot
        of state, an ad-hoc solution may get unwieldy quickly. Next is Vuetify, and, yes, almost all of Vue's
        complimentary libraries have funny names. Vuetify is a component framework, so it's similar to Angular Material,
        and you can use it for many cool things as we'll see. Last one we'll talk about is Vue CLI, or the Vue
        Command-line Interface, which we use to scaffold and build your application. So first of all, Nuxt.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div><h3 class="course-transcript__clip-header">
      Universal Rendering with Nuxt </h3>
      <p>
        So you use Nuxt to create a universal application, you might also call this application server-rendered. If you
        ever tried to build a universal application from scratch, you'll know there are a lot of challenges, not simple
        challenges, not trivial ones, really tricky ones that test your deepest knowledge of front and back-end
        development; however, Nuxt simplifies these challenges. So ideally, you don't even have to think about them.
        They just work. I won't get into details about all the specific features of a universal app, but I will say the
        end result is that it loads faster when you view it on your phone. Is this a big deal? Why don't you ask the
        people making billions of dollars every day because their applications load up faster on their customers' phones
        than their competitors'. Next, let's talk about Vuex.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div><h3 class="course-transcript__clip-header">
      Managing State with Vuex </h3>
      <p>
        So Vuex provides you a way of updating your state. The nature of your state affects the way your components are
        going to look, and the user's interaction may change that state by say introducing a new item to a list or
        changing their name. As the name suggests, it's similar to Flux or Redux. If you've used these libraries or if
        you've seen my excellent course on Pluralsight, Flux and Redux, then you'll already be 99% of the way to using
        Vuex because Vuex just basically takes these technologies and wraps them a up a little bit so it integrates
        nicer with Vue. Personally, I feel that Redux is so general that it makes a good option as well, but Vuex is, in
        a sense, more specific and more tailored to this particular job. Ultimately, the reason why you would use this
        is to keep applications with huge state manageable. If your application state consists of say just an array of
        numbers, then it's not necessary to have Vuex. It would be overkill. But if your application is a big one and
        has hundreds, or even thousands, of pieces of information in the state at any time, then Vuex will prevent this
        from becoming a maintenance nightmare.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div><h3 class="course-transcript__clip-header">
      Building Websites with Vuetify </h3>
      <p>
        Next is Veutify. So Veutify, it contains components that you put into your application, so normally you write
        the components yourself, but Veutify is a solution which comes with a basket of components for you to use. All
        these components have a visually pleasing material design aesthetic. They look smooth, and they give users the
        impression, especially on mobile, that you can just reach out and touch them. So you'd use Veutify if you were
        building an application from the beginning and you knew it was going to have a lot of standard components,
        buttons, lists, accordions, and to save money, you ask your team to use an existing solution for all these
        components rather than making each one yourself. As we know, building components is a lot of work because to
        build them properly, we not only have to build them, but we also have to make sure they're well tested, and
        performant, and compatible on every platform we need.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div><h3 class="course-transcript__clip-header">
      Scaffolding and Collaborating with Vue CLI </h3>
      <p>
        Last is Vue CLI. Now Vue CLI is the one you might see the most because its role is kind of the most essential.
        You need something like Vue CLI at least to get your application off the ground in most cases. So it's a tool
        for creating, building, and updating your Vue applications. Using its command, you can introduce new parts to
        your application and change their structure in a way that's difficult for a new developer to get wrong. Vue CLI
        provides a standard way for your whole team to update the app. No longer does only the senior developer have the
        know how to add a new folder or a new view. In this way, junior developers can take more of the tasks they're
        assigned to. For example, a junior developer may be instructed to add a new page where the user can check their
        settings. Rather than needing a senior developer to actually set up the blank page and the routes that they use,
        they could use Vue CLI, increasing their confidence and saving the senior developer time. The end goal of using
        a Vue CLI is to facilitate productivity with big teams. If your team is only one or two people, then Vue CLI
        might be overkill. But the bigger it gets, the more it makes sense to use this tool. Let's take 2 minutes to go
        over a few Vue CLI commands. There are commands like vue serve, vue build, vue create, and vue ui, which are in
        a sense twins, and vue add. What do they do? Well, typing vue serve into your command line will serve the
        application. It's the same as using HTTP Server or Apache. If you call build, it takes your. vue files, as well
        as ES6 files, and and turns them into JavaScript. This is the command that makes. vue files readable by
        browsers. Saying create or ui creates a new project. Using vue ui implements the very cool Vue User Interface,
        which is kind of this graphical tool that they've made to help you build Vue applications. So here I am in the
        Vue CLI UI. This is a tool that allows us to do everything we can do with the Vue CLI using a convenient
        interface. For example, we can create a new project. The UI lets us do more than just name our project. It
        allows us to define presets, which, for example, can allow us to install Babel and ESLint automatically. It even
        downloads the required packages from npm. Overall, the Vue CLI UI can increase productivity and foster
        collaboration within your team. Lastly, vue add is a way of adding new features to Vue CLI itself. I won't get
        into the details, but for common scenarios like testing or performance there's definitely times where you'd want
        an extra bit of help.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div><h3 class="course-transcript__clip-header">
      Comparison to Existing Frameworks (Angular, React) </h3>
      <p>
        I feel like the vast majority of developers will find this next section interesting wherein we compare Vue to
        existing frameworks. I think this is so because a lot of us are already quite familiar with Angular and React.
        After all, they've been a big deal for many years now. So when I compare Vue to these frameworks in the next few
        minutes, the ideas that I present should be especially meaningful. And if you do not know about these
        frameworks, you can still learn a lot from this clip as in your workplace, you may be called upon to put forward
        your opinion on if you think you should use Angular, or Vue, or React for a particular part of the application.
        At least this way you'll have something intelligent and informed to say. So let's compare them. Is it the best?
        Is there a best framework? As Shakespeare said, and, yes, I do like Shakespeare a lot, "There is nothing either
        good or bad, but thinking makes it so. " In other words, there definitely isn't a best framework. It's all about
        what your opinion is; however, your opinion is important because that's got a really close connection to the
        actual job you're trying to solve. This chart shows the file size of the major frameworks after they've been
        minified. The blue bar represents Vue, while as the orange bars represent other libraries like React, AngularJS,
        and Angular. You'll note that AngularJS refers to the older version of Angular pre-2 and Angular after 2. So as
        you can see, Vue is significantly smaller than React and much smaller than Angular; however, there do exist
        solutions smaller than Vue, for example, Preact, which is a minimally featured version of React. It's almost not
        even a real library because they take so many features out. But I wanted to include it here because Vue isn't
        the smallest solution. If absolute smallness is your goal, then there's even better things than Vue. But Vue
        does a great job of reconciling the small size of Preact with the many useful features of say React. As we know,
        mobile users may get bored and navigate away from your site before they've seen anything if the framework
        doesn't load in time. Thus, this is a telling chart to consult if you're trying to determine which framework to
        use to actually make the most money off your mobile commerce application. So let's compare Vue with React. So on
        the Vue hand, Vue builds fast and scalable apps; it speeds the render up of the application using a virtual DOM;
        it has a proprietary file type,. vue; and Vue is used to group HTML, JavaScript, and a bit of CSS. If you want
        to do more advanced stuff like conditionals or lists in your template, you'd use directives like v-for and v-if.
        When you're not sure about what structure your app should have, Vue CLI makes that task easy. And lastly, with
        Vue, if you don't use the build step, you've got an excellent prototyping solution on your hands. Now let's
        compare this to React. React also builds fast and scalable applications, and it also uses a virtual DOM to speed
        up the render. In this way, they're very similar. React has a proprietary language called JSX that's used to
        group HTML and JavaScript together. If you want to have more functionality, React doesn't have directives. It
        requires on more basic JavaScript, so you'll just use an existing JavaScript map or a ternary and replace for
        v-for and v-if. A lot of people consider these a bit trickier, so React is kind of harder in this sense. React
        has an equivalent of Vue CLI called Create React App, which also makes the structure of your app easy. Now
        unlike Vue, React really doesn't do all that much without JSX, so even if you're building a prototype, you
        should have a build step. This is a bit more work than using Vue where you can skip the build step if you want.
        Overall, they're both great frameworks. In my opinion, the executive summary is they're both awesome, but React
        is a bit harder. Now let's compare Vue to Angular. The picture on the left is Vue, and the picture on the right
        is Angular. That's not to say that Vue is better than Angular. Angular is just more complex. There's no doubt
        that there's some people in this audience that will be much more excited about solving the maze on the right
        than solving the maze on the left because they like a challenge. Being a bit more academic with our comparison,
        first, let's talk about Vue. So in comparison to Angular, Vue is simple and easy to learn because it emphasizes
        plain HTML and JavaScript. Sure, you have. vue files, but those are just essentially HTML and JavaScript
        together. As a module solution, your only option is existing JavaScript modules, and you don't even have to use
        those. So if you've use module. exports or import from, this is what I'm talking about. If you want to integrate
        Vue and make it just one part of your application, but make the rest of the application something else, this is
        easy. And we tend to see the highest productivity with Vue when we're building an application that's medium
        size, not too small, not too big. And you'll recall that when we want to add functionality, we use directives
        like v-for and v-if. Now as for Angular, learning and using Angular is no simple task. Not only does Angular
        have modules and many other tricky things, but you also need to write it in TypeScript. TypeScript is confusing
        enough as it is, so you kind of have to master it before you can even master Angular. It's fun, but let me tell
        you, it's not easy. Now Angular uses JavaScript modules, but it also on top of that has its own module solution
        called Angular Modules, which are cool, but they're also a lot of work to learn as well. Now Angular doesn't
        really play nice with other frameworks. Angular wants to be the chief framework on your page. So while it is
        technically possible, you generally don't look at Angular as the solution to say I'm just going to replace one
        tiny part of my app with Angular. For starters, the library is very large. Speaking of large, one thing that
        Angular does have is that for really big applications, we're talking huge, it's just better suited to building
        them in Vue. Really all the decisions about Angular are kind of geared towards these very, very large projects.
        That's why some things like Angular Modules might seem too confusing. Well, they are for small projects, but for
        big projects, they're a lifesaver. Lastly, if we want to add functionality with directives, we can do them with
        stuff like ng-for and ng-if. Ng-for and ng-if. Those sound very familiar to our Vue directives. In fact, Vue
        took a lot of queues from Angular on how to name and design their directive, so anyone who understands Angular
        will recognize these Vue directives. So I've done a good job of making Vue sound great, but in the next clip,
        we're going to see why Vue might not be so great.

      Vue Pitfalls and Drawbacks </h3>
      <p>
        I'll be the first to admit that my praise of Vue has been lavish, but don't fear because I'm not looking at Vue
        through rose-colored glasses. I've definitely taken some time to think about why Vue might not be the best for
        your solution, and surely it is not right for every project. So what are some drawbacks of Vue. So first of all,
        Vue needs support from its ecosystem to do a lot of things. Once you get past that prototype step, you're really
        going to want to start using these libraries, and once you do, Vue is no longer a matter of just being a simple,
        tiny library. You're getting into dependencies and complexity that rivals that of an Angular or React
        application. Next, Vue has some tricky reactivity. This is because they try and make it quite magical in the way
        that the components respond to data being changed. Compare this to React, which does no such thing. You have to
        tell react to render every time. It's very unmagical. So there's no shortage of scenarios where your components
        might not update in the way you expect. You have to learn to play around these scenarios. Next, while it is true
        that if your developer is familiar with Vue, they'll find the Vue file type easy to use, but if you have a
        developer who's never heard of Vue, then the file type may be confusing. It isn't like anything else out there.
        Finally, while there are production applications using Vue today, compared to React and Angular, it is very new,
        and there are many scenarios which haven't been tested. Probably they will work, but you're taking a bit of a
        risk there, and I consider that a drawback. So let's say at the end of the day you've chosen not to use Vue, but
        to use React or Angular. Why would you have made such a choice? Well, Vue is less established. There's fewer
        existing resources. Maybe you find the fact that Angular and React have a huge amount of English language
        documentation quite comforting, and that's why you've chosen to use it. A fair decision. In addition, perhaps
        you're worried by the fact that many scenarios in production just haven't been tested very much, and if you're
        the first person ever to try this with Vue, then you'll be the one testing it and paying the cost if it doesn't
        work. Lastly, if you're building an application and you know from the beginning that it's going to be huge,
        we're talking enterprise, then you wouldn't be blamed for choosing Angular or React instead of Vue. They're both
        geared for projects that are a little bit larger. So that's it. At the end of the day, there's not really a lot
        of drawbacks, but they're there, and consider them when you try to decide if Vue is right for your project. In
        the last and final clip, outside of the conclusion, I'll be talking a bit more about the build step.

      Executive Summary / Continue Your Education </h3>
      <p>
        I sure have had fun putting this course together. Comparing Vue to React and Angular in so many different ways
        has really increased my appreciation of the JavaScript ecosystem. Let's quickly review the main points of what
        we've discussed in this short course. So Vue is fast, it's lightweight, and it's easy to use. These are all
        things that relate to convenience, and Vue is just kind of the most convenient of the frameworks. Of course,
        stark contrast would not be correct because Vue has much in common with both Angular and React. At the end of
        the day, you might say that its goals are the same, but it tries to do it in a more simple fashion. In addition
        to helping us make a performant and maintainable application, components are very useful when we want to split
        work up among our team of developers. We learned that Vue works without a build step, but that this is better
        reserved for prototypes, and for serious production applications, we can use Vue with a build step. Lastly,
        we've learned that Vue is not the whole story. It has a vibrant ecosystem of supporting libraries. Without that
        ecosystem, Vue really only renders the view layer, takes our data model, mixes it with our components, and spits
        out HTML. Ninety percent of the time, you don't have to think of Vue as being any more complicated than that.
        Finally, let's summarize the advantages of Vue. By knowing the advantages well, you will be qualified to decide
        if Vue is the right library for any given task that you have. Vue has a small package size. It downloads faster
        than React or Angular, making it good for mobile. Vue can omit a build step when necessary, allowing you to
        prototype quickly, but also allowing you to bring it into production by adding that build step. The Vue API,
        which features HTML directives, is familiar to any developers who have worked with Angular. The command-line
        tools allow us to construct our Vue applications in such a way that the structure will be familiar to the whole
        team. Due to its various advantages, it should be your first choice when it comes to prototyping a new feature.
        Having fewer features than React or Angular makes Vue easier to learn and to use. And lastly, a vibrant
        community of open-source developers supports Vue, so you can rely on timely updates and bug fixes. So assuming
        I've convinced you that learning more about Vue is a good way to spend your time, what can you do next? First,
        check out Vue. js Fundamentals by Jim Cooper, here on Pluralsight. You can find the course at the URL displayed
        on the screen. As you can see, unlike this brief overview, View. js Fundamentals spends over 5 hours getting
        into the nitty gritty of how to use Vue. It's an excellent follow up to this course. This covers all the
        important topics that I would cover in a Vue course including components, template syntax, directives, and
        communicating with other components. It even teaches you about Vuex. Very cool. I'd also like to recommend that
        you check out Vue. js: Getting Started by Chad Campbell. This is a course that might be more suitable for
        beginners. Not only is it a beginner-level course with a shorter duration, but it covers various topics that I
        would say, while being equally important, are more fundamental to using Vue. This course goes into much greater
        detail on the basic topics such as templates, simple user events, and the rendering of lists. If you're a
        beginner JavaScript developer or have very little knowledge of Vue, React, or Angular, I'd say this is a
        terrific course to check out next. Finally, we're always coming up with new courses, so check back at
        Pluralsight frequently for brand-new Vue. js courses that cover the latest cutting-edge topics. I'd like to wrap
        this course up with a big thank you to you for watching. This course wasn't the longest, and it wasn't the most
        difficult to get through, but hey, it still takes time and commitment to take a few hours out of your day that
        you could be doing anything you want to spend time with me learning this course. So I hope that it's been as
        enriching for you as it has for me, and I look forward to seeing you in my next great course here at
        Pluralsight. You have a good day.
