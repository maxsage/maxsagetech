          <h3>Module Overview</h3>
          <p>This module introduces the Microsoft® SQL Server® 2016 platform. It describes the
            components, editions, and versions of SQL Server 2016, and the tasks that a database
            administrator commonly performs to configure a SQL Server instance.</p>
          <h4>Objectives</h4>
          <p>At the end of this module, you should be able to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Describe SQL Server components, editions, and versions.</li>
            <li>Describe SQL Server architecture.</li>
            <li>Configure SQL Server services and networking.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Lesson 1 : Introduction to the SQL Server Platform</h3>
          <p>As a DBA, it is important to be familiar with the database management system used to
            store your data. SQL Server is a platform for developing business applications that are
            data focused. Rather than being a single monolithic application, SQL Server is
            structured as a series of components. It is important to understand how you use each of
            these.</p>
          <p>You can install more than one copy of SQL Server on a server. Each of these is referred
            to as an instance and can be configured and managed independently.</p>
          <p>SQL Server ships in a variety of editions, each with a particular set of capabilities
            for different scenarios. It’s important to understand the target business cases for each
            of the SQL Server editions—and how the evolution, through a series of improving versions
            over many years, results in today’s stable and robust platform.</p>
          <h4>Lesson Objectives</h4>
          <p>After completing this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Explain the role of each component that makes up the SQL Server platform.</li>
            <li>Describe the functionality that SQL Server instances provide.</li>
            <li>Explain the available SQL Server editions.</li>
            <li>Explain how SQL Server has evolved.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>SQL Server Components</h4>

          <p>SQL Server includes a powerful relational database engine, but the scope of the SQL
            Server product is far broader than the database engine alone. It is a complete data
            platform built from a group of features offering a wide range of data processing
            functions:</p>

                business applications and data warehouse solutions. SQL Server 2016 also includes a
                memory-optimized database engine that uses in-memory technology to improve
                performance for high-volume, short-running transactions.

          <h3>SQL Server Instances</h3>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig01-002.PNG"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 01-002</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>It is sometimes useful to install more than one copy of a SQL Server component on a
            single server.</p>
          <p>Many SQL Server components can be installed more than once as separate instances.</p>
          <h4>SQL Server Instances</h4>
          <p>The ability to install multiple instances of SQL Server components on a single server
            is useful in various situations:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You might want to have different administrators or security environments for sets of
              databases. You can manage and secure each instance of SQL Server separately.
            </li>
            <li>Some of your applications might require server configurations that are inconsistent
              or incompatible with the server requirements of other applications. You can configure
              each instance of SQL Server independently.
            </li>
            <li>Your application databases might need different levels of service, particularly
              regarding availability. You can use SQL Server instances to separate workloads with
              differing service level agreements (SLAs).
            </li>
            <li>You might need to support different versions or editions of SQL Server.</li>
            <li>Your applications might require different server-level collations. Although each
              database can have different collations, an application might be dependent on the
              collation of the tempdb database when the application is using temporary objects.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can use multiple instances to install different versions of SQL Server
            side-by-side. This functionality can assist when testing upgrade scenarios or performing
            upgrades.</p>
          <h4>Default and Named Instances</h4>
          <p>Before SQL Server 2000, just one copy of SQL Server could be installed on a server
            system. SQL Server was addressed by the name of the Windows® server where it was hosted.
            To maintain backward compatibility, this mode of connection is still supported and is
            known as the “default instance”. For internal configuration tools, a default instance of
            the database engine is named MSSQLSERVER.</p>
          <p>Additional instances of SQL Server require an instance name that you can use in
            conjunction with the server name and are known as named instances. If you want all your
            instances to be named instances, you simply provide a name for each one when you install
            them. You cannot install all components of SQL Server in more than one instance. To
            access a named instance, client applications use the address
            Server-Name\Instance-Name.</p>
          <p>For example, a named instance called Test on a Windows server called APPSERVER1 could
            be addressed as APPSERVER1\Test. The default instance on the same APPSERVER1 server
            could be addressed as APPSERVER1 or APPSERVER1\MSSQLSERVER.</p>
          <p>There is no need to install SQL Server tools and utilities more than once on a server.
            You can use a single installation of the tools to manage and configure all
            instances.</p>

          <p>SQL Server has been available for many years, yet it is rapidly evolving with new
            capabilities and features. It is a platform with a rich history of innovation achieved
            while maintaining strong levels of stability.</p>
          <h4>Early Versions</h4>
          <p>The earliest versions (1.0 and 1.1) were based on the OS/2 operating system. SQL Server
            4.2 and later moved to the Microsoft Windows operating system, initially on Windows
            NT.</p>
          <p>SQL Server 7.0 saw a significant rewrite of the product. Substantial advances were made
            in reducing the administration workload, and OLAP Services (which later became Analysis
            Services) was introduced.</p>
          <p>SQL Server 2000 featured support for multiple instances and collations. It also
            introduced support for data mining. After the product release, SQL Server Reporting
            Services (SSRS) was introduced as an add-on enhancement to the product, along with
            support for 64-bit processors.</p>
          <h4>SQL Server 2005 and Beyond</h4>
          <p>SQL Server 2005 provided a significant rewrite of many aspects of the product:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Support for nonrelational data stored and queried as XML.</li>
            <li>SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) was released to replace several previous
              administrative tools.
            </li>
            <li>SSIS replaced Data Transformation Services (DTS).</li>
            <li>Support for complied .NET objects created using the Common Language Runtime (CLR).
            </li>
            <li>The Transact-SQL language was substantially enhanced, including structured exception
              handling.

          <h3>Lesson 2: Overview of SQL Server Architecture </h3>
          <p>Before you start looking at the resources that SQL Server requires from the underlying
            server platform, you need to know how SQL Server functions, so you can understand why
            each resource requirement exists. To interpret SQL Server documentation, you also need
            to become familiar with some of the terminology used when describing how the product
            functions.</p>
          <p>The most important resources used by SQL Server from a server platform are CPU, memory,
            and I/O. In this lesson, you will see how SQL Server is structured and how it uses these
            resources.</p>
          <h4>Lesson Objectives</h4>
          <p>After completing this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Describe SQL Server architecture.</li>
            <li>Explain CPU usage by SQL Server.</li>
            <li>Describe the role of parallelism.</li>
            <li>Explain how 32-bit and 64-bit servers differ, with respect to SQL Server.</li>
            <li>Describe how SQL Server uses memory.</li>
            <li>Describe the difference between physical and logical I/O.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>SQL Server Architecture</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig01-005.PNG"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 01-005</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>SQL Server comprises many components that work together. Three general categories of
            components exist within the database engine and are structured as layers—query execution
            (also referred to as the relational engine), storage engine, and SQLOS.</p>
          <h4>Query Execution Layer</h4>
          <p>In addition to managing the query optimization process, the query execution layer
            manages connections and security. It uses a series of subcomponents to help work out how
            to execute your queries:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The parser checks that you have followed the rules of the Transact-SQL language and
              outputs a syntax tree, which is a simplified representation of the queries to be
              executed. The parser outputs what you want to achieve in your queries.
            </li>
            <li>The algebrizer converts the syntax tree into a relational algebra tree, where
              operations are represented by logic objects, rather than words. The aim of this phase
              is to take the list of what you want to achieve, and convert it to a logical series of
              operations representing the work that needs to be performed.
            </li>
            <li>The query optimizer then considers the different ways that your queries could be
              executed and finds an acceptable plan. Costs are based on the required operation and
              the volume of data that needs to be processed—this is calculated taking into account
              the distribution statistics. For example, the query optimizer considers the data that
              needs to be retrieved from a table and the indexes available on the table, to decide
              how to access data in the table. It is important to realize that the query optimizer
              does not always look for the lowest cost plan because, in some situations, this might
              take too long. Instead, the query optimizer finds a plan that it considers
              satisfactory. The query optimizer also manages a query plan cache to avoid the
              overhead of performing all this work, when another similar query is received for
              execution.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Storage Engine Layer</h4>
          <p>The storage engine layer manages the data held within databases. The main
            responsibilities of the storage engine layer are to manage how data is stored, both on
            disk and in memory; to manage how the data is cached for reuse; and to manage the
            consistency of data through locking and transactions. The main subcomponents of the
            storage engine layer are as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The access methods component is used to manage how data is accessed. For example,
              the access methods component works with scans, seeks, and lookups.
            </li>
            <li>The page cache manages the storage of cached copies of data pages. Caching of data
              pages is used to minimize the time it takes to access them. The page cache places data
              pages into memory, so they are present when needed for query execution.
            </li>
            <li>The locking and transaction management components work together to maintain
              consistency of your data. This includes the maintenance of transactional integrity,
              with the help of the database log file.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>SQLOS Layer</h4>
          <p>SQL Server Operating System (SQLOS) is the layer of SQL Server that provides operating
            system functionality to the SQL Server components. All SQL Server components use
            programming interfaces provided by SQLOS to access memory, schedule tasks, or perform
            I/O.</p>
          <p>The abstraction layer provided by SQLOS avoids the need for resource-related code to be
            present throughout the SQL Server database engine code. The most important functions
            provided by this layer are memory management and scheduling. These two aspects are
            discussed in more detail later in this lesson.</p>
          <h4>CPU Usage by SQL Server</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig01-006.PNG"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 01-006</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>All work performed in the Windows operating system is based on the execution of
            threads.</p>
          <p>Windows uses preemptive scheduling of threads to maintain control. Rather than
            requiring threads to give up control of the CPU voluntarily, preemptive systems have a
            clock that they use to interrupt threads when the thread’s allocated share of CPU time
            is complete. Threads are considered to have encountered a context switch when they are
            preempted.</p>
          <h4>SQL Server Threads</h4>
          <p> QL Server retrieves threads from Windows. The SQL Server configuration setting max
            worker threads (set at instance level) determines how many threads will be retrieved.
            SQL Server has its own internal scheduling system, independent of the scheduling
            performed by the operating system. Instead of using Windows threads directly, SQL Server
            creates a pool of worker threads that are mapped to Windows threads whenever work needs
            to be performed.</p>
          <p>When a SQL Server component needs to execute code, the component creates a task that
            represents the unit of work to be done. For example, if you send a batch of Transact-SQL
            commands to the server, it’s likely that the batch will be executed within a task.</p>
          <p>When a SQL Server component creates a task, it is assigned the next available worker
            thread that is not in use. If no worker threads are available, SQL Server will try to
            retrieve another Windows thread, up to the point that the max worker threads
            configuration limit is reached. At that point, the new task would need to wait to get a
            worker thread. All tasks are arranged by the SQL Server scheduler until they are
            complete.</p>
          <h4>Affinity Mask</h4>
          <p>Schedulers can be enabled and disabled by setting the CPU affinity mask on the
            instance. The affinity mask is a configurable bitmap that determines which CPUs from the
            host system should be used for SQL Server—and can be changed without needing to reboot.
            By default, SQL Server will assume that it can use all CPUs on the host system. While
            you can configure the affinity mask bitmap directly by using sp_configure, this method
            is marked for deprecation in a future version of SQL Server. Use the Properties dialog
            box for the server instance in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to modify processor
            affinity.</p>
          <p>Processor affinity can be modified at the level of individual processors, or at the
            level of NUMA nodes.</p>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> Whenever the term CPU is used here in relation to SQL Server
            internal architecture, it refers to any logical CPU, regardless of whether core or
            hyper-threading CPUs are being used.</p>
          <p>Waiting for Resources One concept that might be difficult to grasp at first is that
            most SQL Server tasks spend the majority of their time waiting for something external to
            happen. Most of the time, they are waiting for I/O or the release of locks, but this can
            involve other system resources.</p>
          <p>When a task needs to wait for a resource, it is placed on a list until the resource is
            available; the task is then signaled that it can continue, though it still needs to wait
            for another share of CPU time. This allocation of CPUs to resources is a function of the
            SQLOS.</p>
          <p>SQL Server keeps detailed internal records of how long tasks spend waiting, and of the
            types of resources they are waiting for. Wait statistics information can be a useful
            resource for troubleshooting performance problems. You can see these details by querying
            the following system views:</p>
          <figure>
<pre><code class="language-sql">sys.dm_os_waiting_tasks;
sys.dm_os_wait_stats;</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 01-007</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <h4>Parallelism</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig01-008.PNG"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 01-008</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>All operations run against SQL Server are capable of running by using sequential
            elements on a single task. To reduce the overall run time (at the expense of additional
            CPU time), SQL Server can distribute elements of an operation over several tasks, so
            they execute in parallel.</p>
          <p>Parallel Execution Plans Parallel execution involves the overhead of synchronizing and
            monitoring the tasks. Because of this, SQL Server only considers parallel plans for
            expensive operations, where the advantages outweigh the additional overhead.</p>
          <object>The query optimizer determines whether a parallel plan should be used, based on
            aspects of the operation and the system configuration:
          </object>
          <ul>
            <li>A configuration value, maximum degree of parallelism (MAXDOP), determines a limit
              for how many CPUs can be used to execute a query.
            </li>
            <li>Another configuration value, cost threshold for parallelism, determines the cost
              that a query must meet before a parallel query plan will even be considered.
            </li>
            <li>Query cost is determined based on the amount of data the query optimizer anticipates
              will need to be read to complete the operation. This information is drawn from table
              and index statistics.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>If a query is expensive enough to consider a parallel plan, SQL Server might still
            decide to use a sequential plan that is lower in overall cost.</p>
          <h4>Controlling Parallelism</h4>
          <p> The query optimizer only creates a parallel plan and is not involved in deciding the
            MAXDOP value. This value can be configured at the server level and overridden at the
            query level via a query hint. Even if the query optimizer creates a parallel query plan,
            the execution engine might decide to use only a single CPU, based on the resources
            available when it is time to execute the query.</p>
          <p>In earlier versions of SQL Server, it was common to disable parallel queries on systems
            that were primarily used for transaction processing. This limitation was implemented by
            adjusting the server setting for MAXDOP to the value 1. In current versions of SQL
            Server, this is no longer generally considered a good practice.</p>
          <p>A better practice is to raise the value of cost threshold for parallelism so that a
            parallel plan is only considered for higher cost queries.</p>
          <p>For further information, see the Configure the cost threshold for parallelism Server
            Configuration Option topic in the SQL Server 2016 Technical Documentation:</p>

          <p>Virtual Address Space (VAS) is the total amount of memory that an application like SQL
            Server could possibly refer to in Windows. The VAS depends upon the configuration of the
            server.</p>

          <p>32-bit Systems These systems have a VAS of 4 GB. By default, half the address space (2
            GB) is reserved for the system and is known as kernel mode address space. The other half
            of the VAS (2 GB) is available for applications to use and is known as the user mode
            address space. You can change this proportion by using a /3 GB switch in the boot.ini
            file of the operating system (on earlier operating systems) or by using the bcdedit
            program to edit the Boot Configuration Datastore (on more recent operating systems).
            After the /3 GB switch has been configured, 1 GB of the VAS is allocated for the kernel,
            with the remaining 3 GB allocated for applications.</p>

          <p>Note: More fine-grained control of the allocated space can be achieved by using the
            /USERVA switch instead of the /3 GB switch. The /USERVA switch means you can configure
            any value between 2 GB and 3 GB for user applications.</p>

          <p>64-bit Systems Database systems tend to work with large amounts of data and need
            substantial amounts of memory, so that the systems can serve significant numbers of
            concurrent users. SQL Server needs large amounts of memory for caching queries and data
            pages. A limit of 2 GB to 3 GB for VAS is a major constraint on most current systems. As
            is the case with most database engines, SQL Server is best installed on a 64-bit version
            of Windows, instead of a 32-bit version.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>It’s best to install a 64-bit version of SQL Server on a 64-bit version of Windows.
              Full 64-bit systems offer a VAS of 8 TB.
            </li>
            <li>You can install a 32-bit version of SQL Server on a 64-bit version of Windows. This
              configuration provides a full 4 GB of VAS for the 32-bit applications and is based on
              the Windows on Windows (WOW) emulation technology.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>64-bit System Limitations Not all current systems can be implemented as 64-bit systems.
            The most common limitation is the availability of data providers. If special data
            providers are needed to connect SQL Server to other systems (particularly through the
            linked servers feature), it is important to check that the required data providers are
            available in 64-bit versions. For example, the Jet engine is currently only available as
            a 32-bit provider.</p>
          <h4>Overview of SQL Server Memory Management</h4>
          <p>The main memory object of SQL Server is known as the buffer pool. This is divided into
            8 KB pages—the same size as a data page within a database. The buffer pool is comprised
            of three sections:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Free Pages. Pages that are not yet used but are kept to satisfy new memory requests.
            </li>
            <li>Stolen Pages. Pages that are used (formally referred to as stolen) by other SQL
              Server components, such as the query optimizer and storage engine.
            </li>
            <li>
              Data Cache. Pages that are used for caching database data pages. All data operations
              are performed in the data cache. If a query wants to select data from a specific data
              page, the data page is moved from physical storage into the data cache first. Also,
              data modification is only ever performed in memory. Modifications are never performed
              directly on the data files. When a data page is changed, the page is marked as dirty.
              Dirty pages are written to data files by a background process known as a checkpoint.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The data cache implements a least recently used (LRU) algorithm to determine candidate
            pages to be dropped from the cache as space is needed—after they have been flushed to
            disk (if necessary) by the checkpoint process. The process that performs the task of
            dropping pages is known as the lazy writer—this performs two core functions. By removing
            pages from the data cache, the lazy writer attempts to keep sufficient free space in the
            buffer cache for SQL Server to operate. The lazy writer also monitors the overall size
            of the buffer cache to avoid taking too much memory from the Windows operating
            system.</p>
          <p>SQL Server 2014 and SQL Server 2016 include a feature where the buffer pool can be
            extended onto fast physical storage (such as a solid-state drive); this can
            significantly improve performance.</p>
          <p>SQL Server Memory and Windows Memory The memory manager within SQLOS allocates and
            controls the memory used by SQL Server. It does this by checking the available memory on
            the Windows system, calculating a target memory value—which is the maximum memory that
            SQL Server can use at that point—to avoid a memory shortage at the Windows operating
            system level. SQL Server is designed to respond to signals from the Windows operating
            system that indicate a change in memory needs.</p>
          <p>Providing SQL Server stays within the target memory, it requests additional memory from
            Windows when required. If the target memory value is reached, the memory manager answers
            requests from components by freeing up the memory of other components. This can involve
            evicting pages from caches. You can control the target memory value by using the min
            server memory and max server memory instance configuration options.</p>
          <p>It is good practice to reduce the max server memory to a value where a SQL Server
            instance will not attempt to consume all the memory available to the host operating
            system.</p>
          <p>For more information, see the Server Memory Server Configuration Options topic in the
            SQL Server 2016 Technical Documentation:</p>

          <h4>Physical I/O and Logical I/O</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig01-009.PNG"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 01-009</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>A logical I/O occurs when a task can retrieve a data page from the buffer cache. When
            the requested page is not present in the buffer cache, it must first be read into the
            buffer cache from the database.</p>
          <p>This database read operation is known as a physical I/O.</p>
          <p>Because access to data through physical I/O is typically much slower than access to
            logical I/O or CPU resources, it’s important to optimize physical I/O as far as
            possible, to keep a SQL Server instance performing well.</p>
          <h4>Reducing Physical I/OReducing Physical I/O</h4>
          <p> From an overall system performance point of view, two I/O aspects must be
            minimized:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You need to minimize the number of physical I/O operations.</li>
            <li>You need to minimize the time taken by each I/O operation that is still required.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Minimizing the number of physical I/O operations is accomplished by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Providing enough memory for the data cache.</li>
            <li>Optimizing the physical and logical database layout, including indexes.</li>
            <li>Optimizing queries to request as few I/O operations as possible.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Reducing the time taken by physical I/O operations is accomplished by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ensuring that SQL Server data files are held on sufficiently fast storage.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>One of the major goals of query optimization is to reduce the number of logical I/O
            operations. The side effect of this is a reduction in the number of physical I/O
            operations.</p>
          <p>Note: Logical I/O counts can be difficult to interpret as certain operations can cause
            the counts to be artificially inflated, due to multiple accesses to the same page.
            However, in general, lower counts are better than higher counts.</p>

          <h4>Monitoring Query I/O Operations</h4>
          <p>Both logical and physical I/O operation counts can be seen for each query by setting
            the following connection option:</p>
          <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-sql">SET STATISTICS IO ON;</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 01-010</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>The overall physical I/O operations occurring on the system can be seen by querying the
            sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats system function. The values returned by this function are
            cumulative from the point that the system was last restarted.</p>
          <h4>Demonstration: CPU and Memory Configurations in SSMS</h4>
          <p>In this demonstration, you will see how to review and configure SQL Server CPU and
            memory by using SSMS.</p>
          <h4>Demonstration Steps</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Ensure that the 20765B-MIA-DC and 20765B-MIA-SQL virtual machines are running and
              log on to 20765B-MIA-SQL as ADVENTUREWORKS\Student with the password Pa$$w0rd.
            </li>

          <p>Put the following SQL Server architectural layers in order from highest (closest to the
            client application) to lowest (closest to the operating system) by numbering each to
            indicate the correct order.</p>

          <h4>Lesson 3: SQL Server Services and Configuration Options</h4>
          <p>A SQL Server instance consists of a number of services running on a Windows server.
            Whether you are managing the configuration of existing instances or planning to install
            new instances, it is important to understand the function of the various SQL Server
            services, in addition to the tools available to assist in configuring those services.
            The SQL Server Configuration Manager is the principal configuration tool you will learn
            about in this lesson.</p>
          <p>Note: Many topics in this lesson do not apply to an Azure SQL Database. The
            configuration and management of service accounts for Azure SQL Database is not exposed
            to Azure users. However, these topics apply to SQL Server instances running on virtual
            machines in the Azure cloud.</p>

          <h4>Lesson Objectives</h4>
          <p>At the end of this lesson you will be able to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Describe the SQL Server services.</li>
            <li>Understand the requirements for service accounts for SQL Server services.</li>
            <li>Describe the configuration of SQL Server network ports, aliases, and listeners.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>SQL Server Services</h4>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig01-011.PNG"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 01-011</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>SQL Server services run on a Windows server. When you install SQL Server, you can
            choose to install some or all of the available features, which means that some or all of
            these will be installed. Only the services required to support the installed SQL Server
            features will be present.</p>
          <p>The available SQL Server services include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>SQL Server</strong>. This is the service for the SQL Server database engine.
            </li>
            <li><strong>SQL Server Agent</strong>. This service is responsible for automation,
              including running jobs and issuing alerts.
            </li>
            <li><strong>SQL Server Analysis Services</strong>. This service provides online
              analytical processing (OLAP) and data mining functionality.
            </li>
            <li><strong>SQL Server Reporting Services</strong>. This service is involved in the
              creation and execution of reports.
            </li>
            <li><strong>SQL Server Integration Services 13.0</strong>. This service performs the
              tasks associated with extract, transform, and load (ETL) operations.
            </li>
            <li><strong>SQL Server Browser</strong>. By default, named instances use dynamic TCP
              port assignment, which means that, when the SQL Server service starts, they select a
              TCP port from the available ports. With the SQL Browser service, you can connect to
              named SQL Server instances when the connection uses dynamic port assignment. The
              service is not required for connections to default SQL Server instances, which use
              port 1433, the well-known port number for SQL Server. For connections to named
              instances that use a TCP-specific port number, or which specify a port number in the
              connection string, the SQL Server Browser service is not required and you can disable
              it.
            </li>
            <li><strong>SQL Full-Text Filter Daemon Launcher</strong>. This service supports the
              operation of full-text search; this is used for the indexing and searching of
              unstructured and semi-structured data.
            </li>
            <li><strong>SQL Server VSS Writer</strong>. Use this to back up and restore by using the
              Windows Volume Shadow (VSS) copy service. This service is disabled by default; you
              should only enable it if you intend to use VSS backups.
            </li>
            <li><strong>SQL Server PolyBase Engine</strong>. This service provides the engine used
              to query Hadoop and Azure Blob storage data from the SQL Server database engine.
            </li>
            <li><strong>SQL Server PolyBase Data Movement</strong>. This service carries out the
              transfer of data between the SQL Server database engine and Hadoop or Azure Blob
              storage.
            </li>
            <li><strong>SQL Server Launchpad</strong>. This service supports the integration of R
              language scripts into Transact-SQL queries.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Note: The service names in the above list match the names that appear in both the SQL
            Server Configuration and Windows Services tools for SQL Server 2016 services. In these
            tools, the names of services that are instance-aware will be followed by the name of the
            instance to which they refer in brackets—for example, the service name for the database
            engine service for an instance named MSSQLSERVER is SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER).</p>
          <h4>Configuring Services</h4>
          <p>You use SQL Server Configuration Manager (SSCM) to configure SQL Server services, and
            the network libraries exposed by SQL Server services, in addition to configuring how
            client connections are made to SQL Server.</p>
          <p>You can use SSCM to control (that is, start, stop, and configure) each service
            independently; to set the startup mode (automatic, manual, or disabled) of each service;
            and to set the service account identity for each service.</p>
          <p>You can also set startup parameters to start SQL Server services with specific
            configuration settings for troubleshooting purposes.</p>
          <h4>Managing Service Accounts</h4>
          <p>Each SQL Server service must run in the security context of a service account. You can
            use several types of accounts for SQL Server services, so it is important to know the
            differences between them when planning a secure SQL Server installation. The account you
            choose for each service will require the privileges that the service needs to run;
            however, you should avoid using accounts, such as administrative accounts, that have
            excessive privileges and rights. Follow the principal of least privilege when choosing
            service accounts—never use an account that has greater privileges than it requires for
            doing its job. Ideally, each service should run under its own dedicated account. This
            minimizes risk because, if one account is compromised, other services remain
            unaffected.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig01-012.PNG"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 01-012</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>When you use the SQL Server Setup installation program (or the SQL Server Configuration
            Manager) to specify a service account, the account is automatically added to the
            relevant security group to ensure that it has the appropriate rights.</p>
          <p>Note: Because it automatically assigns accounts to the correct security groups, use the
            SQL Server Configuration Manager to amend SQL Server service accounts. You should not
            use the Windows Services tool to manage SQL Server service accounts.</p>
          <p>The different types of accounts that you can use for SQL Server services include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Domain user account</strong>. A nonadministrator domain user account is a
              suitable choice for service accounts in a domain environment.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Local user account</strong>. A nonadministrator local user account is a
              secure choice for service accounts in a nondomain environment, such as a perimeter
              network.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Local system account</strong>. The local system account is a highly
              privileged account that is used by various Windows services. Consequently, you should
              avoid using it to run SQL Server services.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Local service account</strong>. You use the local service account, a
              predefined account with restricted privileges, to access local resources. This account
              is used by Windows services and other applications that do not require access to
              remote resources; generally, a dedicated service account for each SQL Server service
              is preferred. If your database server runs on Windows Server 2008 R2 or later, you can
              use a virtual service account instead (see below).
            </li>
            <li><strong>Network service account</strong>. The network service account has fewer
              privileges than the local system account, but it does give a service access to network
              resources. However, because this account is often used by multiple services, including
              Windows services, you should avoid using it where possible. If your database server
              runs on Windows Server 2008 R2 or later, you can use a virtual service account instead
              (see below).
            </li>
            <li><strong>Managed service account</strong>. Managed service accounts are available if
              the host operating system is Windows Server 2008 R2 or later (Windows 7 also supports
              managed service accounts). SQL Server support for managed service accounts was
              introduced in SQL Server 2012. A managed service account is a type of domain account
              that is associated with a single server, and which you can use to manage services. You
              cannot use a managed service account to log on to a server, so it is more secure than
              a domain user account. Additionally, unlike a domain user account, you do not need to
              manage passwords for managed service accounts manually. However, a domain
              administrator needs to create and configure a managed service account before you can
              use it.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Virtual service account</strong>. Virtual service accounts are available if
              the host operating system is Windows Server 2008 R2 or later (Windows 7 also supports
              virtual service accounts). SQL Server support for virtual service accounts was
              introduced in SQL Server 2012. A virtual service account is similar to a managed
              service account, except that it is a type of local account that you can use to manage
              services, rather than a domain account. Unlike managed service accounts, an
              administrator does not need to create or configure a virtual service account. This is
              because a virtual service account is a virtualized instance of the built-in network
              service account with its own unique identifier.

          <h4>Configuring Network Protocols</h4>

            <figcaption>Fig 01-013</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>You use SQL Server Configuration Manager to configure SQL Server services and the
            network libraries exposed by SQL Server services, in addition to configuring how client
            connections are made to SQL Server.</p>
          <h4>Server Network Ports and Listeners</h4>
          <p>You can configure each network endpoint that is exposed by an instance of SQL Server.
            This includes the determination of which network libraries are enabled and, for each
            one, the configuration of the network library. Typically, this will involve settings
            such as protocol port numbers. You should discuss the required network protocol
            configuration of SQL Server with your network administrator.</p>
          <p>Three protocols are available:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>TCP/IP</li>
            <li>Named pipes</li>
            <li>Shared Memory</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The configuration for the TCP/IP protocol provides different settings on each
            configured IP address if required—or a general set of configurations that are applied to
            all IP addresses.</p>
          <p>By default, only the Shared Memory protocol (which means client applications can run on
            the same server to connect) is the only protocol available when a new SQL Server
            instance is installed. Other protocols, where client applications can connect over a
            network interface, must be enabled by an administrator; this is done to minimize the
            exposure of a new SQL Server instance to security threats.</p>
          <h4>Client Network Ports and Listeners</h4>
          <p>SQL Native Client (SNAC) is installed on both the server and client systems. When SQL
            Server management tools are installed on the server, they use the SNAC library to
            connect to the SQL Server services on the same system. Every computer with SNAC
            installed should have the ability to configure how that library will access SQL Server
            services. For this reason, in addition to server network configuration settings, SSCM
            includes client configuration nodes with which you can configure how client connections
            are made. Note that two sets of client configurations are provided and that they only
            apply to the computer where they are configured. One set is used for 32-bit
            applications; the other set is used for 64-bit applications. SSMS is a 32-bit
            application, even when SQL Server is installed as a 64-bit application.</p>
          <h4>Aliases</h4>
          <p>Connecting to a SQL Server service can involve multiple settings such as server
            address, protocol, and port. If you hard-code these connection details in your client
            applications—and then any of the details change—your application will no longer work. To
            avoid this issue and to make the connection process simpler, you can use SSCM to create
            aliases for server connections.</p>
          <p>You create a server alias and associate it with a server, protocol, and port (if
            required). Client applications can then connect to the alias by name without any concern
            about how those connections are made. Aliases can provide a mechanism to move databases
            between SQL Server instances without having to amend client connection strings. You can
            configure one or more aliases for each client system that uses SNAC (including the
            server itself). Aliases for 32-bit applications are configured independently of those
            for 64-bit applications.</p>
