              Conditional Rendering and Rendering of Lists
            </h3>
            <p>
              The last module showed you how to respond to user events in Vue. That discussion gave me the opportunity
              to show you how to handle things like button clicks and pressing keys. These types of interactions are
              used in most apps. In fact, in Growler, if you click the Search button or press the Enter key, you would
              expect a search to run. Once run, you would expect that query to return a list of results.</p>
            <p>In this module, I'm going to show you how to render those results. In this module, we're going to look at
              a number of directives in Vue that deal with rendering. This module will begin with a discussion on
              rendering elements conditionally. From there, we'll dive into rendering lists of items. As part of this,
              you'll see how to create item templates and react to list changes. Growler will really take shape in this
              module. For that reason, I'm really excited for this module. I think you should be too.

            <h3>
              Rendering Elements Conditionally
            </h3>
            <p>
              Vue has several directives to help you show and hide elements when certain conditions are met. These
              directives relate to development concepts like if/else statements. Vue's conditional directives are best
              used in different situations. Some of these directives are better used when an app is loaded, while others
              are better used at runtime.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>
              Rendering Conditionally on Load
            </h3>
            <p>
              As apps grow in size, they can take longer to load. In this situation, you should strive to create a great
              loading experience in your app. You can do this by rendering elements after they've loaded. This can be
              useful if your app is coming from a slower network connection, or if you need to wait for additional
              JavaScript object initialization.</p>
            <p>To demonstrate what a poor experience could look like, I've created an example which looks like this:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-001.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-001</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="example">Module 05 - simulation with poor load time</p>
            <p class="example">Module 05 - v-cloak in action</p>
            <p>This example is part of the sample repo that's part of this course. That repo can be found here:</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/ecofic/course-vue-getting-started">https://github.com/ecofic/course-vue-getting-started</a>
            <p>Still, in this example, the load of Growler is intentionally delayed by 3 seconds. This is to simulate a
              slow network connection. Notice how the area on the left shows the binding syntax. This happens because
              nothing is hiding the content while the Growler view is being created. If a user sees this, they may think
              that the app is broken. However, the area on the right is a bit cleaner. The user doesn't see anything
              until Growler has been created. This is made possible by the cloak directive.</p>
            <p>The cloak directive hides elements until a view is compiled. In module 1, we discussed that compilation
              happens right after a view has been created. To use the cloak directive, you add it to an element, like
              this:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-002.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-002</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>As you can see, I simply added the cloak directive to the header element. You can probably imagine that
              cloak can be used with a loading indicator in an app. Still, you should probably be aware that you can't
              just apply the cloak directive to hide content while an app is loading. In fact, to actually hide content,
              you must also include this CSS in your app:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-003.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-003</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This CSS sets the display property of an element that includes the cloak directive. I typically place
              this CSS definition in a shared CSS file so that it's widely available in my app. In fact, this CSS
              definition is in the public/css/app. css file in the sample repo for this project. If you look at it,
              you'd see the code above, which sets the display property to none. The none value on the display property
              hides the element, however, this property value doesn't impact layout, it only impacts the visibility.
              This behavior helps prevent a jerky experience when an app is transitioning from the loading state to the
              running state. Once your app is running, you may want to conditionally show and hide elements at runtime.

            <h3>
              Rendering Conditionally During Runtime
            </h3>
            <p>
              Vue provides several directives that empower you to conditionally render elements during runtime. One of
              these directives is a familiar if/else construct. There's also an additional directive called show. These
              directives serve unique purposes. For that reason, I'm going to cover these directives in detail in this
              section.</p>
            <p>The if/else directives let you conditionally render content based on an expression. If an expression
              returns a truthy value, the condition will be met, and the element will render. If the expression does not
              evaluate as truthy, the element will not be rendered. For example, look at the following sample:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-004.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-004</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>In this example, I'm showing the number of beers returned on a search in Growler. The cloak directive is
              used to hide any bindings until Growler is created. Once Growler has been created, these if/else
              directives determine what to render based on the number of beers found. If no beers were found, this
              descriptive block of text is shown:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-005.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-005</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>If a single beer was found, this block of text is shown:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-006.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-006</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Finally, if more than a single beer was found, this block of text is shown:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-007.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-007</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>If you get the exercise files for this course and run this sample for yourself, you'll see a screen that
              looks like this:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-008.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-008</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="example">Module 05 - if/else directives</p>
            <p>Each time you click the Search button, a random collection of beers will be generated. This could cause a
              different block in the if/else statement to get rendered. I bring this up, because each time the value
              changes, the elements and all of their children will be destroyed and reconstructed. It's not a big deal
              in this small example, but it's something to keep in mind from a performance perspective for more complex
              user interfaces. If you need to toggle something regularly, you may want to consider the show
              directive.</p>
            <p>The show directive is another option to conditionally show content at runtime. As shown in the following
              example:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-009.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-009</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="example">Module 05 - v-show directive</p>
            <p>The show directive is similar to the if directive. Earlier, I used the if/else directive to conditionally
              show information. Those directives were appropriate in that case because I wanted to show a grammatically
              correct phrase. In this example, though, I'm using the show directive because I'm showing or hiding a
              block of elements. This approach is slightly different, because in this case only the display css property
              is changed.</p>
            <p>The show directive is a way to conditionally set the CSS display property at runtime. If the expression
              on this directive evaluates as falsy, the elements display property will be set to none. This also means
              that when you use the show directive, it will always render the element. The show directive is used to
              simply show or hide an HTML block.</p>
            <p>At this point, you may think the show and if directive are pretty similar. You might want to know what
              makes them differ from each other. While the if and show directives are similar, there are some important
              differences.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-010.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-010</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p> First, the if/else directives are better for more complex logic, while the show directive is better for
              basic logic. That's why the if/else directives were used when showing the count of beer results. If it
              wasn't for the need to handle the case where a single beer was returned, a show directive would have been
              better. The reason why is because of rendering.</p>
            <p>The show directive always renders an element, however, the if directive only renders the content if an
              expression is truthy. In other words, the if directive conditionally renders elements. From this behavior,
              we can draw two conclusions. First, the if directive has higher toggling costs at runtime than the show
              directive. At runtime, the if directive destroys and recreates the virtual DOM as conditions change. On
              the other hand, the show directive just toggles the CSS display property, which is faster at runtime.</p>
            <p>The second conclusion is that if something is unlikely to change after a rendering, it's better to use an
              if directive. The show and if directives are important to keep in mind when rendering content
              conditionally at runtime. For the smoothest experience, use the cloak directive while your view is
              loading. Still, rendering individual items are one thing, rendering lists of items are another.

            <h3>
              Rendering Lists of Items
            </h3>
            <p>
              Vue provides one directive that's focused on lists of items. That directive is called for. The for
              directive can be used in a number of ways. You can use the for directive to loop a specific number of
              times through an object, or through a list. I'm going to show you how to use the for directive to tackle
              each of these scenarios. I'm also going to show you what happens when you use the for directive and the if
              directive together.

          <div>
            <h3>
              Looping a Specific Number of Times
            </h3>
            <p>
              In some situations, you know the exact number of times that you want to loop. For example, in Growler, we
              know the number of pages of search results that are returned by a search. This information, and the for
              directive, could be used to create a search results pager like this:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-011.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-011</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="example">Module 05 - example 01</p>
            <p>In this code snippet, I'm using an HTML unordered list to house a list of pages. Notice that the for
              directive isn't placed on the ul tag, though. Instead, I've placed it on the list item element, because
              that's the element that needs to be repeated. This template will repeat until the limit is reached. In
              total, the number of list item elements created will match pageCount. That's because when looping to a
              number, like pageCount, Vue automatically iterates by an interval of 1.</p>
            <p>Notably, the alias itself also starts at 1. The alias is a variable used in the context before a
              directive. This variable represents the current item that's being iterated on. When looping through a
              range of numbers, like in our paging example, this value starts at 1. This may surprise you if you've
              worked with other programming languages. In other languages, this value would likely start at 0, however,
              when working with numbers, Vue automatically starts this value at 1, not 0. This lets you bind the page
              alias in the template to get what you want.</p>
            <p>Next to the alias is a delimiter called in. The delimiter helps make the for directive more readable. In
              this case, the delimiter is the word in, however, you have the choice to use the term of instead:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-012.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-012</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The decision to choose in or of comes down to personal preference. The reason that of is an option is
              because of is more consistent with JavaScript's iterator syntax. Either way, we'll be using the in
              delimiter in this course.</p>
            <p>To the right of the delimiter is the source data. The source is what's being iterated over. You can
              iterate over a range of integers, however, you cannot iterate over a range of floating-point numbers. You
              can only use whole integer values in a for directive when looping a specific number of times. If you try
              to use a floating-point number, you'll get an error in your view. For that reason, when you need to loop a
              specific number of times, you need to use integers. The for directive is useful for other scenarios,
              though, including traversing object properties.

          <div>
            <h3>
              Traversing Object Properties
            </h3>
            <p>
              The for directive can be used to traverse object properties. The cool thing is, you don't even have to use
              a different syntax. In fact, if you use a JavaScript object as the source for a for directive, like
              this:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-013.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-013</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="example">Module 05 - getting property values</p>
            <p>You'll get a list of the property values in the object. In this example, each property value of
              currentUser would appear as a list item in the view, meaning this HTML would get rendered like this:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-014.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-014</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>From this rendering, you can see that if a property is a string or a number, the value simply appears,
              however, if a property is an array or another object, it will be rendered in a string representation.
              Using a for directive to get property values is pretty straightforward. You can also use the for directive
              to get the property names. To get each property's name and value, you can loop through an object like
              this.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-015.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-015</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="example">Module 05 - getting property keys</p>
            <p>If you look closely at the for directive, you'll notice that I added the k parameter. This parameter
              represents the key or property name for the current property. So if this code were rendered, you'd see
              this.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-016.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-016</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The for directive's flexibility doesn't stop there, though. You can also get the current index while
              looping.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-017.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-017</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="example">Module 05 - getting property index</p>
            <p>In this example, I've added the i parameter to the for directive. This parameter represents the current
              iteration index. With each iteration, I'm using the value, key, and index of each property. Now, if this
              view was rendered, you'd actually see all three of these components as shown on the screen:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-018.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-018</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>While not surprising, there is an interesting detail here. Earlier, while showing the for directive loop
              a specific number of times, I mentioned that the alias starts at 1. Here on the screen, though, you can
              see that 0 is shown. The reason for this is because when looping over a range, the alias starts at 1. This
              is just a nice little thing that Vue does. But in the context of properties, the alias starts at 0, not 1.
              This is consistent with many programming languages, including JavaScript. There is one detail that is not
              consistent across JavaScript engine implementations, though.</p>
            <p>To iterate over an object, Vue gets the list of keys using the JavaScript Object. keys function. This
              function returns an array of enumerable properties in a JavaScript object. I'm mentioning this, because
              different JavaScript engines return these properties in different orders. For that reason, if you need to
              list the properties in a consistent order, you will need to create the array of properties yourself. In
              either case, the for directive can be helpful when you're traversing object properties. It can also be
              helpful when iterating through arrays.

              Iterating Through Arrays
            </h3>
            <p>
              You can use the for directive to iterate through JavaScript arrays. You can iterate over arrays of values,
              arrays of objects, and even arrays of arrays. To demonstrate, let's assume in Growler that we wanted to
              create the search results pager. This time, though, the number of pages aren't in a numeric property, like
              this:</p>

            <p class="example">Module 05 - iterating through an array of values</p>
            <p>Instead, they'll be created in an array like this:</p>

              <img src="./images/Fig05-020.png"/>

            </figure>
            <p class="example">Module 05 - iterating through an array of objects</p>
            <p>This slide shows a pre-defined JavaScript array called pages. The HTML template loops through the array
              and creates a list item with a link for each page. This for directive syntax has already been shown
              several times, however, this time we're iterating through an array of values. If we wanted to loop through
              an array of objects, we could by doing some like this:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-021.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-021</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>In this example, we're creating the pager by using an array of objects called pages. Each object in this
              array contains a number and a URL. These two properties are bound in the template during rendering. In
              this case, we're using the attribute binding syntax and the semantic binding approach described in module
              2. In some situations, you may want the index of the current item in the array. You could get that index
              using an approach similar to the one used earlier, like this:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-022.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-022</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="example">Module 05 - getting the index of an array object</p>
            <p>In this example, I've added the indexer parameter i. Beyond that, everything else is the same. While
              you've seen the indexer approach, you haven't seen how to iterate through nested arrays. Let's pretend
              that each page object in our pages array has a property called sections. This property may be used to
              divide a result page into multiple groups. This updated array may look something like this:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-023.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-023</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="example">Module 05 - iterating through an array of arrays</p>
            <p>On this slide, I'm looping through each page in pages using the for directive again. While working with
              each page, though, I also loop through the nested array named sections using an inner for directive:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-024.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-024</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>In my semantic binding, I'm referencing data from the outer for directive here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-025.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-025</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and data from the inner for directive here:</p>

              <figcaption>Fig 05-026</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>When items are associated with groups, you often need to use conditional logic, which raises the
              question, what happens if an element uses both an if directive and a for directive?
            </p>

            <h3>
              Using v-for and v-if Together
            </h3>
            <p>
              When a for directive and an if directive are used on the same element, the for directive has higher
              precedence. This means that while a for directive is iterating, it will run first on each iteration. Then,
              the if directive will get run separately. This is handy if you only want to render specific items in a
              list.</p>
            <p>For example, in Growler, let's pretend that you wanted to let the user filter the beer results based on
              the alcohol by volume level. That might look something like this:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-027.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-027</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="example">Module 05 - using v-for and v-if together</p>
            <p>This approach may be used with search results to filter out beers that have more alcohol than you prefer.
              You can see that as I slide the slider, the list of beers changes.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-028.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-028</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This is happening because each beer in the underlying array is getting rendered conditionally at runtime.
              This rendering is happening via the HTML template shown on this slide:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-029.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-029</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Here on the left, you can see an array of hard-coded beers. Each beer has a name and an alcohol by volume
              value. By default, we're setting the maximum alcohol by volume level at 7%:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-030.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-030</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This property is bound to the slider in the HTML template:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-031.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-031</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The array of beers is bound as list items using the for directive:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-032.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-032</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>While iterating, Vue will decide whether or not to render each beer, by comparing the current beer's abv
              to the maxAbv value.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-033.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-033</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This works because the iteration happens before the comparison. In other words, the for directive takes
              precedence over the if directive. Using if directives on the same line as a for directive can help you
              create compact templates. Creating a compact template can help you keep your code clean if you're
              rendering lists of items. While the items I've shown up to this point have been static, that's not always
              the case. In fact, to deliver a smoother experience, you may need to change an array at runtime.

            <h3>
              Detecting Array Changes
            </h3>
            <p>
              In module 2, I explained how templates can automatically react to property changes. This is possible due
              to the change notification and dependency tracking features that happen behind the scenes. However, I also
              mentioned that these features do not automatically happen on native JavaScript arrays. Instead, you must
              use a different approach if an array changes or is replaced.</p>
            <p>When an array changes, it mutates. Vue has seven baked-in mutation functions to change an array as
              needed. These seven functions are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>sort</li>
              <li>reverse</li>
              <li>push</li>
              <li>pop</li>
              <li>shift</li>
              <li>unshift</li>
              <li>splice</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each of these functions are wrappers around the standard JavaScript array functions of the same names.
              The reason these wrapper functions are needed is to trigger Vue updates. If you're unfamiliar with these
              functions, don't worry, I'm going to go through each of them. If you are familiar with these JavaScript
              functions, I encourage you to at least watch the first one, so you can see the syntax used in Vue.

              Using the Sort Function
            </h3>
            <p>
              The sort function puts elements in an array in order. For example, let's pretend that I have an array of
              beer names defined like this:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-034.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-034</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="example">Module 05 - Sorting an array of strings</p>
            <p>If I applied the sort function like this:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-035.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-035</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The array would be sorted in ascending order. This happens because, by default, the sort function treats
              each element in the array as a string, and orders elements in ascending order. Now, imagine the array were
              a list of alcohol by volume values:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-036.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-036</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="example">Module 05 - Sorting an array of numbers</p>
            <p> If that were the case, you would see a slightly different result. In fact, let's imagine there's an
              array called abv, which contains these values. Now, if I applied the sort function to this array, I would
              get this result:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-037.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-037</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Notice that the numbers are not in numerical order. This is because, by default, the sort function treats
              each element in the array as a string, even if it's another type. to overcome this behavior, you must
              customize the sort function like this:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-038.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-038</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>On this slide, I'm using an override of the sort function. This override accepts a comparison function.
              During the sort operation, this function determines how two array elements should be ordered in relation
              to each other. These elements are passed in as the parameters. It is your responsibility to return a
              negative, 0 or positive value when comparing the elements.</p>
            <p>A negative value means that the first parameter should be in the array before the second parameter. A
              value of 0 means that there should be no change in the order. Finally, if a positive value is returned,
              the first parameter should be in the array after the second parameter. In the context of this slide:</p>
            <figure>

              <figcaption>Fig 05-039</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>All of this was condensed down to this single line of code. At this point, you've seen how to use the
              sort function to arrange an array in ascending order. Now, imagine you wanted to show things in descending
              order. In that situation, you may want to use the reverse function.

            <h3>

            </h3>
            <p>
              The reverse function rearranges an array into the opposite direction. Put simply, the reverse function
              reverses an array. To demonstrate, let's revisit the array of beer names.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-040.png"/>

            <p>
            <p>This array has already been sorted in ascending order. If I apply the reverse function, the beer names
              will now appear in descending order:</p>

            </figure>
            <p>This isn't just for changing the direction of a sort, though. Let's take a smaller, unsorted array:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-042.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-042</figcaption>

            <p class="example">Module 05 - Reversing an unsorted Array</p>
            <p>
              If the reverse function were to be applied, it would appear like this:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-043.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-043</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Notice in this example that the elements in the array are reversed. No sorting was applied before the
              arranging happened. Once again, the reverse function is purely for changing the direction of an array. If
              you need to manage elements in an array, you might consider the push and pop functions.

              The push function adds items to the end of an array. After an item is added to the array, the push
              function returns the updated length of the array. Let's revisit the list of beer names for a second:</p>

            <p class="example">Module 05 - Push items onto an Array</p>
            <p>I could add a beer named Pope Lick Porter to this list with the push function, like this</p>

            <p>As you can see, the Pope Lick Porter was added to the end of the list. If I wanted to remove this beer, I
              could look to the pop function. The pop function removes the last element from an array. Once removed, the
              pop function returns the item that was removed from the array. Notice that this differs from the push
              function, which returned the array length. So if I took the array from the last slide, and then called the
              pop function, this would be the result:</p>

            array. If you need to work with items at the beginning of an array, you may consider the shift and unshift
            functions.

            <p>
              To add items to the beginning of an array, you can use the unshift function. Personally, the name of this
              function has always made me do a double-take. The idea that I need to call a function name with the prefix
              of un to add something has always thrown me off. Still, just like the push function, once the item is
              added to the array, the unshift function will return the new length of the array.</p>
            <p>An example of adding a beer name to the beginning of an array would look like this.</p>

            <p>That new length would get returned by the unshift function call. If I chose to remove the Pope Lick
              Porter that I just added, I could use the shift function.</p>
            <p>The shift function removes the first item of an array. Once removed, this function will return that item.
              This is similar to the pop function, except that instead of removing the last item, the shift function
              removes the first item. So if you wanted to remove the Pope Lick Porter from the array that was shown on
              the previous slide, you could, like this:</p>

            <p class="example">Module 05 - Shift items off an Array</p>
            <p>As visible on this slide, the shift function removes the first item from the beers array. You've also
              seen how to remove items from the end of an array. If you need to remove items from the middle of an
              array, you need to do some splicing.

            <h3>
              Splicing an Array
            </h3>
            <p>
              When it comes to array management, the splice function is the Swiss Army knife of array functions. The
              splice function lets you add and remove items to and from an array. You can add or remove items to or from
              the start, middle or end of an array.</p>
            <p>Since I've already shown you how to add and remove items from the start and end of an array, let's talk
              about the middle of an array. Let's once again visit a list of beers.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-053.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-053</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="example">Module 05 - Removing a specific number of items with splice</p>
            <p>In this list, we have four beers. Now, imagine that we wanted to remove the middle two beers. To remove
              the Hyote Chocolate Stout and the Ahool Ale, you could use the splice function like this:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-054.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-054</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>In this example, I'm using the splice function to remove two beers from the beers array. The first
              parameter is a required integer. This integer specifies where in the array to begin adding or removing
              items. The second parameter is optional, however, on this slide it means that I want to remove the two
              beers beginning at the first index. Had I not included it, all beers beginning with the first index would
              have been removed from the array.</p>
            <p class="example">Module 05 - Removing remaining items with splice</p>
            <p>In either case, the splice function would return the removed items into their own array. The beers array
              itself would get updated to this.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-055.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-055</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The splice function isn't just for removing items, though. You can actually use the splice function to
              insert items into an array. For example, let's take our updated list of beers and add the removed beers
              back into the array. We could do that like this:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-056.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-056</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="example">Module 05 - Inserting items with splice</p>
            <p>In this code snippet, I'm looping through the list of beers that were previously removed. The splice
              function is responsible for adding each beer back to the list:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-057.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-057</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The first parameter specifies that I want to begin adding beers after the first item in the array:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-058.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-058</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>When adding items with the splice function, the second parameter is required:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-059.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-059</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Since we don't want to remove any beers, I've set it to 0. Then, I'm passing in the name of the beer to
              add it to the list:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-060.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-060</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Once completed, we get the following list of beers:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-061.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-061</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Splicing is a great way to add and remove elements to an array, however, you can also use the splice
              function to update existing elements in an array.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>
              Updating an Array Element
            </h3>
            <p>
              Up to this point, I've shown you how to update an array using a variety of mutations functions, however,
              in some situations you may want to update an individual item in an array. For example, we've been changing
              a list of beers. Now, imagine that in this array we discovered that the Ahool Ale wasn't just an ale.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-062.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-062</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Instead, we learned that it should be a pale ale. In that case, we could update the Ahool Ale item like
              this:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-063.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-063</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="example">Module 05 - Updating an array item</p>
            <p>In this snippet, I'm using a function that's baked in to Vue. This utility function is necessary,
              because Vue cannot detect updates to individual array elements. This is due to the limitations of
              JavaScript explained at the start of module 2.</p>
            <p>Still, Vue provides a utility function named set to help you get past this limitation. In this example,
              the first parameter is the array that's getting updated:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-064.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-064</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              The second parameter is the index of the item in the array that we want to update</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-065.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-065</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Finally, the third parameter is the new value:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-066.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-066</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>When executed, this line tells Vue to update the UI. This will result in the following:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-067.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-067</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>If you prefer to stay closer to JavaScript APIs, you can by using the splice function:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig05-068.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 05-068</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>If you prefer to use the splice approach, this example becomes this. Everything on this slide is the
              same, except for the code used to update the Ahool Pale Ale. This line of code is exactly one character
              longer than vue. set approach. For that reason, it's a marginal change if you prefer to use splice over
              the vue. set function. There's no difference here, it comes down to personal preference.</p>
            <p>Still, that's how you can update an array element. You also saw how to add and remove elements from an
              array. You also saw how to rearrange arrays with the sort and reverse options. This module was about more
              than that, though. In this module, you learned how to handle array changes. This is important because
              arrays are often the data source for lists of items in a view. For that reason, you also saw how to render
              lists of items. In addition, you learned how to conditionally render elements.</p>
            <p>While these features help you display exactly what you want, there are ways to do it even better. In the
              next module, I'm going to show you how to react to data changes to get even better performance in your
              view.
