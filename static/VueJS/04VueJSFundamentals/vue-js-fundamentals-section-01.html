              <p>Hi everyone. This is Jim Cooper, and welcome to my course on Vue.js Fundamentals. I've been working as
                a full-stack developer for more than 20 years, and I've been a serious front-end developer for the past
                6 years, working with AngularJS, Angular, React, and now Vue. js.</p>
              <p>Having spent some time in all of those frameworks, I'm excited to bring you this course on Vue. js
                Fundamentals. Of all the frameworks, I've found Vue to be the most enjoyable, intuitive, and
                lightweight. It is pure joy to work with. But there's still a lot to learn.</p>
              <p>In this course, we'll start where every Vue.js application should start, with the Vue CLI. We'll use
                the CLI to generate our project, and then we'll immediately start exploring how to build applications as
                we start creating our own Vue components and learning how components interact and communicate with each
                other.</p>
              <p>We'll also learn a lot about the Vue. js router, including how to create and navigate between routes
                and how to work with route params, named views, child routes, and route guards. Then we'll dive into
                managing state throughout our application with Vuex, and we'll see how to use Vuex to communicate
                asynchronously with APIs. We'll also learn how to use directives to easily decorate components or other
                elements with nicely encapsulated functionality. And we'll see how to use filters to format and modify
                data right from within our HTML templates. And of course, a web framework fundamentals course wouldn't
                be complete if you didn't learn how to package applications up and deploy them to production. We'll
                explore Vue's excellent tooling that makes creating production deployments a breeze.</p>
              <p>By the end of this course, you'll know everything you need to know to create production-ready Vue
                applications. Before beginning the course, you should be familiar with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                Some knowledge of single-page applications will also be helpful, but if this is your first time jumping
                into single- page apps, that's fine too. So please join me on this journey to learn Vue with the Vue. js
                Fundamentals course at Pluralsight.
