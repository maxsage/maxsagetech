          <div><h2>Getting Started with the Vue.js CLI</h2>
            <div><h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>Hello. This is Jim Cooper, and welcome to this Vue. js Fundamentals module on getting started with the
                Vue. js CLI. In this module, we'll spend a few minutes gaining a high-level understanding of Vue.js
                applications, and then we'll dive into creating our first project with the Vue CLI.</p>
              <p>We'll even start writing some of our own code in this module, including building this home page for the
                Build-a-Bot application that we'll build throughout this course. We're going to have some fun in this
                course using Vue to create a simple website for building and buying custom robots.</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-001.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-001</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>This application will be rich enough to demonstrate all the fundamental concepts you need in order to
                create your own applications with Vue, but it will also be simple enough that we won't waste our time
                building unnecessary features that have no educational value.</p>
              <p>And this is what it'll look like when you're finished.</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-002.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-002</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>As you can see, I can come to the build page and start customizing my robot:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-003.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-003</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>And I can build the robot that I want and then click Add to Cart to add it to my cart. And then you can
                see, it shows up in my cart here:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-004.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-004</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>and I even show which robots I saved money on, if they happen to be on sale. And back on the Build
                page, I can click on any of these parts and learn more about the individual parts:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-005.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-005</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>This site doesn't seem like much, but there's a ton of concepts and learning built into this. It will
                be just enough to allow us to dive into things like creating components and child components,
                communicating between those components, routing and navigation, state management, and even API calls to
                a separate server. We'll even explore how to build and deploy this application to production. So let's
                jump right in and start learning about Vue.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div><h3>Gaining a Conceptual Understanding of Vue</h3>
              <p>At the heart of a view jess application, you find the Vue instance, is created whenever you call new
                view. In a typical view application, you will only ever have one Vue Instance.</p>
              <p>When you create a view instance, you will usually tell it to render a component, which you do by
                passing in an options object with a render function, which tells it to render an app component:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-006.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-006</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>This app component is the top level component in what will become a hierarchical component structure,
                so you can imagine your view instance wrapping your entire application:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-007.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-007</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>and inside that you have your App component and the App component may have a child component:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-008.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-008</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>which then may have other child components, etc. This should feel familiar if you've written any
                Angular or React applications, the component structure is similar other than the Vue instance. In a Vue
                application that includes routing, which is probably most view applications there's another piece.</p>
              <p>Basically, instead of the App component containing other components, or maybe in addition to it
                containing other components, it will also contain a router view:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-009.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-009</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Which shows the content for the current Url and as the Url changes, the content inside the router view
                is updated. And while there is a lot more to a Vue application, this is a pretty good conceptual
                overview of the main structure of a Vue App. To understand the rest of the details. Let's jump into
                creating an app from the ground up.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div><h3>Setting up the Environment</h3>
              <p>We're going to need a few tools installed to get going. First, we'll need Git installed. I'm on
                Windows, so I'm going to use Git for Windows, which can be downloaded from here:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-010.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-010</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>If you're on a Mac, you can install SCM Git from here. And if you're on Linux, you can just run a
                command like this one:</p>
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">sudo apt-get install git</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-011</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>from the terminal. I'll go ahead and download and install Git for Windows, and then I'll run that, and
                I'll just use the defaults throughout the install. And now that that's installed, I have this new Git
                Bash console that I can run:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-012.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-012</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>so we'll use that in a minute. And actually, while I prefer to use this Bash console, sometimes Windows
                users have issues with it, so if you're getting weird errors, try using the Windows console window
                instead.</p>
              <p>The next thing I need is Node. I prefer to install Node using Node Version Manager, just because it
                makes it easier to switch between versions of Node as I develop different applications. On Windows, I
                can download that from here:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-013.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-013</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>For Linux and Mac, you can just run this command from the terminal:</p>
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">curl -o-
                  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.32.0/install.sh | bash</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-014</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>So I'm going to go ahead and install NVM for Windows. And I'll just use all the default options here
                too. Okay, now that that's installed, I'm going to open my Git Bash console. On Windows, be sure to open
                it as an administrator. Okay, now that I have NVM installed, I can just run:</
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">nvm install 8.11.2</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-015</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>and then the version of Node that you want to install. It's recommended that you use this version for
                this course, if you're following along, to avoid any compatibility issues. And now I can just tell NVM
                to use this version of Node:</p>
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">nvm use 8.11.2</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-016</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Okay, we're good to go with Git and Node now. If you have problems using NVM to install Node, you can
                try installing it directly from here:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-017.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-017</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Just choose the correct installer for your system. Okay, let's get coding.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div><h3>Creating a New Project with the Vue CLI</h3>
              <p>We're going to use the Vue CLI to create our new project. If you're using Vue to create a project that
                you're going to deploy to a production environment, I highly recommend you use the CLI. The CLI
                represents a lot of thought and effort by the Vue team to create an environment where you can easily
                work in development, and when you're ready, create an optimized production build. So to get started,
                let's install the Vue CLI.</p>
              <p>We'll do that from the terminal. On Windows, we need to use the Bash terminal we just installed, and
                then we just need to use npm to install the Vue CLI globally, like this:</p>
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">npm install -g @vue/cli</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-018</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Typically, this is all you'll do to install the CLI. But for this course, we're going to install a
                specific version like this:</p>
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">npm install -g @vue/cli@3.0.0-rc.3</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-019</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>If you're following along with this course, be sure to use this same version to ensure you don't run
                into any surprises or problems a long the way. And you can see that I'm using a release candidate
                version of the CLI. That's because version 3 of the CLI is not yet released. But don't worry; even
                though we're using an RC version of the CLI, it will still install a non-RC version of the Vue itself.
                We don't expect there to be any major changes to the CLI before final release, and since doing things
                with version 3 of the CLI is quite different from doing things with version 2, you'll be learning the
                new way to do things.</p>
              <p>Okay, now that that's installed, we can use it to generate our project. So I'm in my dev folder where I
                want to create my project:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-020.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-020</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>and now I can just run this command:</p>
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue create build-a-bot</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-021</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>So this is going to create a new Vue project and is going to create that new project in a build-a-bot
                directory. Okay, so notice here that I can either choose to install according to a default preset, or I
                can choose this option to manually select which features to bootstrap my project with:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-022.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-022</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Let's go ahead and choose Manually select features. So you can see that the Vue CLI starts with a
                handful of out-of-the-box features to choose from:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-023.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-023</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Each of the features listed here has the ability, when you select one, to do several things, including
                things like prompting you for more information on the command line, modifying the webpack config,
                installing npm packages, and generating files.</p>
              <p>This is all based on a new Vue plugin architecture as of CLI version 3. And the whole idea is to create
                a zero-config environment, meaning they've done a lot of the thought to create all the webpack and other
                configs so you don't have to worry about that.</p>
              <p>Now usually, that sort of thing makes me nervous because when framework developers say you won't have
                to worry about it, it usually means I'm going to have to worry about it, and it's going to be a pain to
                work with when I do. And as you look at this out-of-the-box list, you might think, well, this is great
                if this list contains the features that I want, but what if I need something else? Or what if I don't
                choose something here and I want to add it later? Well, not to worry. Forget to install one of these? No
                problem, just add it later. Don't see a feature that you want? No problem, anyone can create a plugin
                and add it later. And there's a good chance you'll find that the community has created one for you. And
                when you do need to make changes to the webpack config yourself, you can do that too, all without ever
                having to eject from the CLI. This is all part of an attempt to create a zero-config or low-config
                environment, and they've done a stellar job of it. Of course, if you need to do some custom
                configuration, you can do that too.</p>
              <p>For now, let's just go ahead and add Babel and a linter. We're going to use a router and Vuex later,
                but we'll add those then so you can see how to do that. Okay, so now that I've selected this by hitting
                Space, I can hit enter to continue, and now we need to choose our linter options.</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-024.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-024</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>And I'm going to go ahead and choose ESLint with the Airbnb config. I really like the Airbnb
                configuration for code styling, so I'll go ahead and select that. So I'll hit Enter, and then I'm going
                to select Lint on save:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-025.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-025</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>so that it will execute my linter whenever I save a file. Now I'm going to go ahead and hit Enter
                again. And then I have an option here as to whether to put my config in my package.json or in dedicated
                config files.</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-026.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-026</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>And I like it in dedicated config files, so I'll select that. And then here I have the option to save
                all of these options that I've selected as a preset for future projects.</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-027.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-027</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>If I do that, then when I create a new project in the future, I can select that preset instead of
                having to go through all these options again. But I'm just going to go ahead and so no here.</p>
              <p>Okay, so now it's generating our project for us and installing all of our npm dependencies:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-028.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-028</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Cool. Now that that's done, let's take a quick peek at what it generated, and then we'll start writing
                some code of our own. So I'm going to open up my code editor, and I'm using Visual Studio Code, so I'm
                going to change directory into my new build-a-bot folder, and then I'll just type:</p>
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">code.</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-029</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>and that should start Visual Studio Code in this directory.</p>
              <p>I highly recommend VS Code for working with Vue because it has a lot of great Vue extensions that offer
                some incredible support for working in Vue. In fact, let's take a look at those extensions. So notice
                here that I have an ESLint plugin, Vetur plugin, and a vue plugin:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-030.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-030</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>I recommend you install each of these if you're following along or if you're going to be doing Vue
                development in Visual Studio Code. And if you're unfortunate enough to be working in Windows like I am,
                you'll want to update a rule in your ESLint file. So right here we have this. eslintrc. js file, and I
                need to add a rule here to make it so that it handles Windows line endings correctly. So I'm just going
                to add rules, and I'm going to set linebreak-style to 0:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-031.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-031</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Now this won't give me warnings due to my Windows-style line breaks. And then one last thing to
                configure for linting with Vue, over here in my workspace settings, I've configured some ESLint rules
                for formatting Vue files:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-032.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-032</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>So notice here that I'm telling ESLint to validate HTML, Vue, and JavaScript files. And notice for each
                one of these sections that autoFix is set to true:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-033.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-033</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>So whatever I save, if there are linting errors, it will autofix them for me. And then notice down here
                that I have eslint. autoFixOnSave set to true also. I've found that these settings are all required in
                order to really get ESLint working well and code formatting and styling working well with Vue files.</p>
              <p>All right, now that we've got our editor set up the way we want, let's take a look at what the CLI
                generated for us. We'll start with the package.json file. If we take a look at the scripts in the
                package.json file right here, you can see that it created these three scripts for us, all of which call
                the vue-cli-service.:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-034.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-034</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>The vue-cli-service manages a local dev webserver that is based on webpack DevServer.</p>
              <p>We're not going to cover the vue-cli-service in depth in this course, but you can learn more about it
                here:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-035.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-035</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>For now, we're just going to go ahead and run this serve script. So back in our terminal, we can just
                run:</p>
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">npm run serve</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-036</figcaption>
              </figure>

              <p>And that's going to compile our application for development and then start a development server for us
                on port 8080:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-037.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-037</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>There we go. Now let's go take a look at that:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-038.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-038</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Cool. So we can see that we have a running application here, and this is the sample web page that
                always gets generated from the CLI. This just gives us a good starting point that we can start editing.
                So let's take a look at how this is all working and being rendered. So back over here, we'll take a look
                at our main.js file in the src directory:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-039.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-039</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>This is the entry point for our Vue application:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-040.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-040</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>and you can see it's really simple. Notice we're just creating a new Vue instance here, and then we
                pass in this options object:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-041.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-041</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>to configure our Vue application. And all we're currently configuring is the render property. Notice
                that the render property is set to a function and that we're passing this App component into it:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-042.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-042</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>And all we're currently configuring on our Vue instance is the render property. Notice that the render
                property is rendering our App component, so when Vue bootstraps our app, it will start by displaying the
                App component. So let's take a look at that next.</p>

              <p>So first of all, notice that there are three sections to this file, a template section:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-043.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-043</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>a script section:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-044.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-044</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>and a style section:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-045.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-045</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Clearly, this is not a file that a browser could understand, so the question is, how is this getting
                used? Well, consider a couple of things. First of all, there is a Vue-specific webpack plugin being used
                to parse this file into its individual parts and compile them in a way that a browser can use them. And
                secondly, this component was passed into the Vue instance, so Vue will work with what's generated by
                webpack to render this component. We'll talk more about components and each of these sections in the
                next module. For now, all you need to understand is that this App component is the top-level component
                in our app, and as we build our app, it will remain at the top level of our component hierarchy, as it
                is used to display routed components and their child components.</p>
              <p>Right now, there is no routing at work here. The App component is just displaying this HelloWorld
                component:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-046.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-046</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>So the App component is displaying this as a child component, and if we go look at that component,
                which is in this components folder, you can see that here is all the HTML and all the links that are
                currently being displayed in our app. Cool, so that's how everything is wired up that was generated by
                the CLI. Next, we'll start replacing this content with some of our own.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div><h3>Creating the Home Page</h3>
              <p>Alright, in this clip we're going to start creating some of our own content. We won't be exploring any
                new concepts just yet. We're just going to spend a little bit of time replacing this generated
                content:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-047.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-047</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>
                with some of our own content. This will get us a little more familiar with what the CLI generated and
                with the layout of our new app before we start digging into key Vue.js concepts. So let's start by
                renaming this HelloWorld component. This will become our new home page, so let's name it
                HomePage.vue:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-048.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-048</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>
                We could just name it Home.vue, but one of the Vue style guide rules says that components should be two
                words at a minimum. So we'll name it HomePage. And let's update the component name down here too:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-049.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-049</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>And then we'll have to update the import for this in the App component, so instead of importing
                HelloWorld, we'll import HomePage from HomePage.vue:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-050.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-050</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>and then we'll use that down here:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-051.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-051</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>And we'll change it up here in the template:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-052.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-052</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>And we don't need this msg attribute anymore, so we'll delete that:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-053.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-053</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>And I'd like to put all of this inside a main element:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-054.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-054</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>And we don't want this Vue logo up here anymore:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="./images/Fig01-055.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-055.png</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>so we'll delete that. All right, and then let's add a couple of styles and clean up some styles that we
                don't need. So down here in the style section of our App component, I'd like to add a gradient to the
                body of our application. So I'm going to give it a background, I'm going to set linear-gradient to a
                gradient from top to bottom, and let's fix that spelling error, and then I want to set the
                background-attachment to fixed:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-056.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-056</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>And then down here on the app element, I'm just going to remove everything except our font family:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-057.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-057.png</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>
                And by the way, this app element is just referring to this div up here that has an id of app:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-058.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-058</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>And then I just wanted to add a few styles for this main div, so down here I'll add a main style. And I
                want to set margin to 0 auto, so this will center the main content, and we'll add some padding and give
                it a background-color of white and a width of 1024px and then just a min-height of 300px:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-059.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-059</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Okay, we'll talk more about components and styling them in the next module. We're just trying to get a
                decent starting point set up here, and then we'll delve into this stuff more. So let's go see what our
                site looks like now:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-060.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-060</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Okay, ignore the main content area, but notice that our background has a gray gradient now, and our
                main content area has a white background. Now let's go replace all of this content with our HomePage
                content. So back in our HomePage component, up here in the template, all right, so let's delete all of
                this content inside the outer div, and we'll change this class to home:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-061.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-061</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>And then I'm just going to go ahead and paste a little bit of content here. If you're following along,
                go ahead and paste this in:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-062.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-062</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>And then notice that we just have a couple of divs here:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-063.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-063</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>One just has an image of a robot, and the other has a get-started link. So notice that this image is
                loading robot-home.png file out of the assets folder, but that file doesn't exist in here:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-064.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-064</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>This is just the Vue logo that came with our Vue CLI sample page. So let's go download that
                robot-home.png file. To help us with this and a number of other tasks throughout this course, I've
                created a little helper repo over here in GitHub for the Vue.js Fundamentals course:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-065.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-065</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>And there's just a few files in here that we will occasionally use to download things as we go
                throughout this course. So in the src folder, notice we have an assets folder, and here is the
                robot-home.png file:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-066.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-066</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>And we'll actually need this other image, too, so we might as well download them both. So first I'll
                click on robot-home, and then click on Download, and then Save image as, and then I just need to go find
                my build-a-bot folder. And in the assets folder, we'll just save it here:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-067.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-067</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>And then we can go back and do the same thing for this build-a-bot logo. So we'll save that here too.
                Okay, cool. So now that robot-home image exists in our assets folder:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-068.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-068</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Now we just need to clean up some styles down here. And we don't need any of these:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-069.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-069</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>so I'm just going to add a few classes here. So we have a home class, and I just want that to be
                text-align: center, and then a robot class, and I just want to set the height to 300px:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-070.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-070</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>This is for that robot image. So let's go see what our site looks like now:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-071.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-071</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Okay, cool. This is looking great now. And you may have noticed that I didn't need to hit refresh on
                this page in order to see my changes. That's because we are using, behind the scenes Vue CLI is using
                the webpack DevServer, including Hot Module Replacement. So as we make changes to our code, the changes
                immediately show up in our browser without us having to refresh.</p>
              <p>Okay, awesome. So now we've created a new home page. But let's add one more thing that we're going to
                use throughout this course. Our site is missing a navigation header, so let's add that quick. And we
                could add that to our home component, but then when we navigate away from our home page, we would lose
                that navigation header. So really we want it to be on our App component. So up here just above our main
                element, we're going to add a header element:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-072.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-072</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>And that's going to have a nav element:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-073.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-073</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>and this nav element is nothing special. It's not Vue specific; it's just a normal HTML element that
                comes with HTML 5. And then inside here, we're going to use an unordered list to list out each of the
                nav elements:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-074.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-074</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>And for now, that's just going to have one list element, and that will have a nav-item class:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-075.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-075</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>And then inside here we're going to have an image, which will be our logo, so we'll give that logo
                class. And this is going to be the other image that we downloaded, so in our assets folder, it is the
                build-a-bot-logo.png file:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-076.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-076</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>And then we'll just say Build-a-Bot here:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-077.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-077</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>And now we just need to add some styles to style that. Again, we'll cover styling in more depth in the
                next module. But rather than have you type in all the styles, let's go over to our helper repo, and in
                the src folder, there is this header.css:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-078.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-078</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>And we're just going to click on the raw version of that and copy all of it, and then let's just paste
                that all in right here:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-079.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-079</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Okay, so you can see we're just adding some header and nav item styling here and some styling for our
                logo. Okay, let's go take a look at that:</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Fig01-080.png"/>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-080</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>All right, awesome. So you can see here, again, without having to refresh, Hot Module Refreshment just
                updated our page for us, and we now have a navigation bar at the top with a list item here on the left
                for navigating to our home page. And that's not a link yet or anything. We'll update that later. But now
                we have a home page with a navigation bar in our App component. And I realize that this clip was just a
                bit of just following along, not a lot of new concepts. But hopefully as we moved around in the app and
                replaced some HTML in our home page component and our App component, you began to become a little bit
                more familiar with the layout of our application, and hopefully that will help a bit going forward.</p>
              <p>In the next module, we're going to dive into components and templates syntax and start learning a lot
                more concepts. So in this module, we just learned some high-level things about Vue, and how to use the
                Vue CLI to create a project, and a little bit about working within components and making some HTML and
                CSS changes. In the next module, we're going to take a much deeper look at components and templates in
                text, so let's go jump into that.
