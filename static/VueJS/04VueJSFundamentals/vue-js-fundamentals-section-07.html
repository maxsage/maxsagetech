        <div><h2>Creating Custom Directives and Filters</h2>
          <div><h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Welcome to this module on creating custom directives and filters. In this module we'll learn how to
              create and use our own directives similar to directives we've already been using, such as v-if. We'll also
              learn about view filters and how to create and use them. We'll learn about:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Creating and using custom directives,</li>
              <li>Passing data to directives</li>
              <li>Declaring directives locally versus declaring them globally,</li>
              <li>Creating and using filters</li>
              <li>Declaring filters locally versus declaring them globally</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Alright, let's check it out.</p>
          </div>
          <div><h3>Creating a Custom Directive</h3>
            <p>View comes with a handful of built in directives that we've been using already in our application. For
              example, this v-if attribute:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-001.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-001</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>is actually a directive. Same with v-show and v-for. But what if we want to create our own directives?
              Let's explore how to do that. If we take a look at our robot builder, when we select a part that's on
              sale, it shows this sale icon down here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-002.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-002</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This is happening in our part selector. If we go take a look at that it's this span right here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-003.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-003</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And this span is being displayed in the bottom right hand corner using CSS. Imagine though if I had a
              common need for pinning an element down in the bottom right hand corner. Instead of having to always
              create a class that absolute positions the element in the bottom right hand corner, I could just create a
              directive that does it for me. Let's do that for this sale element.</p>
            <p>So to start with let's come down to the CSS and remove the positioning attributes out of this sale class.
              So we'll remove position, bottom, and right:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-004.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-004</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And then I want to be able to pin an element to the bottom right hand corner just by adding a directive
              like this. So here I want to be able to just say v-pin:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-005.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-005</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And then just because I added this directive, this element will be pinned in the bottom right hand
              corner. So let's go create this directive. So in the shared folder I'm going to create a new file and
              we'll call that pin-directive.js:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-006.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-006</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Alright, and then to start with this is just going to export an object:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-007.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-007</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And then a directive has a handful of methods that act as hooks. One of the most commonly used hooks is
              the bind hook:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-008.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-008</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So this is just a function that we put on this object. And then this gets called as soon as the directive
              is bound to its parent component. And the first parameter that gets passed in here is the element
              itself:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-009.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-009</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              So in the case of our part selector that's going to be this span element right here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-010.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-010</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And this pin directive is going to be really simple. I just want to apply some styles to the element that
              is being passed in. So I can do that by just grabbing this element and then setting the style.position
              property to absolute. And then I'll also set the bottom and right attributes to five pixels. And then the
              same thing for the right attribute:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-011.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-011</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And then that's it. That's all there is to creating this directive. Now in our parts selector component
              we need to import our new directive, so import pin directive from shared pin directive:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-012.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-012</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And then we can just declare this locally in our component with a directive section here and then that
              takes an object where the key is the name of the directive that you're going to use in your template, and
              then the directive that we imported, so pin directive</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-013.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-013</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And now because we've defined this as a directive here and named it pin, I can now use that up here in my
              directive like this:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-014.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-014</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So notice that v- is pre pended to the name of the directive that we created. Okay, this should be
              working just fine so let's go check it out:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-015.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-015</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>There we go. So it's showing in the bottom right hand corner and then just to demonstrate that this is
              coming from the directive, let's remove the directive from this element:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-016.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-016</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and then refresh here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-017.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-017</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And then there you go. You can see the positioning is off. So let's go ahead and put that back. Awesome,
              that was really simple.</p>
            <p>Now let's go take a look at how we can pass some data into our directive.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div><h3>Passing Data to Directives</h3>
            <p>Our new pin directive is kind of cool but it's not very flexible. It's always going to pin items to the
              bottom right corner. Let's make it so that we can tell the directive where to pin itself. There are a
              couple of different ways that we can pass information to a directive. So let's explore them both.</p>
            <p>The first is through the use of args. So back over here where we're using our directive, we can use args
              to tell our pin directive we want it to be pinned to the top right like this:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-018.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-018</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So here I'm using args to say I want to position this in the top right corner. It's fairly expressive and
              to the point. The first part of this expression:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-019.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-019</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>position, is called the arg and the parts that follow it, separated by periods:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-020.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-020</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>are called modifiers. So position is the arg and top right are the modifiers. And then back over here in
              our directive we can get access to that information through the second parameter, which is binding:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-021.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-021</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And the binding has a couple of properties that we're interested in, arg and modifiers. So let's just
              console.log those out for a second to see what those look like:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-022.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-022</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So we'll console.log the arg and then the modifiers. Okay and let's go look at that:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-023.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-023</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So if we open our console here there we can see that we're getting a couple of things logged out. So arg
              is positioned and modifiers is an object with two properties, right, which is set to true, and top that is
              set to true. So modifiers is an object that contains each modifier set to true if they exist.</p>
            <p>So back in our directive, we'll check the first arg to make sure that it's set to position and if not
              we'll just do nothing, so get rid of our console. log here and then we'll just say if binding. arg does
              not equal position, then we'll just return and do nothing because the data being passed in is not in the
              format that we expect:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-024.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-024</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And then basically I want to loop over each of the modifiers and apply the style that pins the element to
              the corresponding position:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-025.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-025</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So to do that I'm going to use object.keys, which enumerates all the keys on an object. And so we want to
              enumerate over all the keys on the binding modifiers object. And then for each of those we will call this
              function and then the key will be passed in and then for each key in the keys here are going to be top and
              right, I just want to set element.style with that key equal to five pixels. So this will set
              element.style.top to five pixels and element.style.right to five pixels if those are the modifiers that
              are passed in.</p>

            <p>Okay and then we can get rid of these down here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-026.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-026</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So we'll always set the position to absolute and then we will set the top and right and in this case,
              because we're passing in top and right here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-027.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-027</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>we will set top and right to five pixels. If we send in something else other than top and right those
              will get set to five pixels. Okay, let's go see how this is working:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-028.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-028</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              So if we look at a sale item, there we go. It is pinned to the top right now. Alright, let's go see what
              happens if we change this to be pinned to the bottom left:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-029.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-029</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And let's refresh that. And you'll notice that you saw some really weird behavior there when we came back
              here before we refreshed:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-030.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-030</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And we'll get into that in a minute here. But notice if I do a full refresh on my page that it is now in
              the bottom left:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-031.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-031</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So when I first came back to here before I refreshed, keep in mind that hot module replacement is at work
              here and so as we're making changes, hot module replacement, which is part of the web hack server, is
              applying those changes to our website without doing a full page refresh. And what was happening here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-032.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-032</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>is hot module replacement was still doing its job but our directive wasn't noticing all of the changes.
              And that's why it was pinned actually to the top right and the bottom left and so it made the entire image
              red. So in the next clip we'll cover why it wasn't noticing those changes.</p>
            <p>But first I had mentioned that there are a couple of ways to pass data into a directive, so let's look at
              the other way. The second way isn't quite as expressive but it's much more flexible. So instead of using
              args and modifiers we're going to pass everything in as an object. So I'm going to set v-pin equal to an
              expression and that expression is going to be an object:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-033.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-033</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And we'll use that object to define the position. So let's say we want this to be pinned to the bottom
              with 10 pixels of spacing, and to the right with five pixels of spacing:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-034.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-034</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So this object is going to be passed into the directive and you can see how this is more flexible than
              the args notation because I can actually pass values for each one of the arguments that I want to pass
              into the directive. </p>
            <p>So over in our directive we can access that with binding.value.:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-035.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-035</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Okay and then we're going to delete this check here for binding.arg. And then we're going to change our
              loop to loop over the keys in binding.value:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-036.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-036</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So binding.value is set to whatever we passed into our directive here. So it's this bottom right
              object:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-037.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-037</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              And then we will set that to binding. value.position where position is the value being passed in here. So
              let's rename this to position just to be a little bit more clear:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-038.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-038</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So for example, in this example here where we're passing in bottom 10 pixels and right 10 pixels, then
              position here is going to be bottom and right. So we're going to set element.style.bottom to
              binding.value.bottom. So this would set bottom to 10 pixels in this case. Okay, let's go check that out.
              There we go. Now you can see that this is showing in the bottom right but you can see there's 10 pixels
              from the bottom and five pixels from the right:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-039.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-039</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Okay and to show that we can now configure it let's come back over here and let's change right to 50
              pixels and see what that does.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-040.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-040</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Okay notice that again, we changed it, but we're not seeing any change here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-041.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-041</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and we won't see that change until we refresh. So there, now we can see that it's 50 pixels to the
              right:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-042.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-042</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So the question is, why are we not seeing this unless we refresh? Because our hot module replacement is
              working. But this is actually a problem with our directive where our directive is not noticing the
              changes. So in the next clip let's take a look at the different directive hook functions. This will help
              us fix this problem.</p>
          </div>
          <div><h3>Using Directive Lifecycle Hooks</h3>
            <p>You may have noticed throughout this course that we've had hot module replacement working, which causes
              our dev changes to be immediately rendered without having to refresh the browser. And you may have also
              noticed that our changes to our directive have been requiring us to hit refresh, and this is due to the
              life cycle hook that we're binding to in the directive. So over here in our directive you can see that
              we're using the bind life cycle hook:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-043.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-043</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This hook gets fired when the directive is first bound to the element. So this code only gets fired once.
              But demonstrating this with hot module replacement is obscuring the issue, so let's create a better way to
              demonstrate the problem.</p>
            <p>So over here in our part selector component, instead of hard coding the padding here, let's bind to it.
              We'll use a new pin padding property. And we'll use that in both places here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-044.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-044</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              And then to help demonstrate that let's also just display that pin padding right here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-045.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-045</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And then let's just make it so that when we click on this sale element it sets the pin padding to 30
              pixels:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-046.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-046</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Okay, so the attributes for our bottom and right are set to pin padding and then when you click on this
              element we set pin padding to 30 pixels. In order for this to work we need to add it to our data function
              down here. So we'll add pin padding and let's default that to 10 pixels.:</p>
            <p>So when the component first loads this will be set to 10 pixels and then when we click on the sale
              element it will change it to 30 pixels. Okay, so let's go take a look at this.</p>
            <p> So let's refresh and then over here, so you can see that the pin padding is set to 10 pixels:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-047.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-047</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and actually, where we place this is not very easy to see so let's move this interpolation up here to the
              top:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-048.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-048</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>That should make it easier. There we go. So you can see that our padding is set to 10 pixels. And when I
              click on this element it will change it to 30 pixels:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-049.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-049</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>There you can see it changed it to 30 pixels up here but notice that our directive didn't get updated.
              And this is because we are only binding to the bind life cycle hook in our directive. So there is another
              life cycle hook that we can bind to and it's the update hook.</p>
            <p>So right here let's add an update life cycle hook and that takes in element and binding also:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-050.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-050</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And then this update function is actually going to do the exact same thing as our bind function. So let's
              extract this out here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-051.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-051</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We're going to cut this out of here and we'll create a new function called applyStyle and that will take
              in element and binding. And then we'll just paste that code in here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-052.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-052</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Okay so now we have this apply style and we can actually call that from bind and from update:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-053.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-053</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Okay so now our directive will also get updated whenever its parent component is updated, which includes
              when the directive's bindings are updated. So let's go check this out. So come back over here now and
              let's refresh one last time and then come over here. Now notice when I click on this that the directive is
              updated:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-054.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-054</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So the directive is noticing changes now on the bindings of its parent element. Okay now there are three
              other life cycle hooks that can be tapped into including inserted, which fires whenever the bound element
              has been inserted into its parent node.</p>
            <p>componentUpdated, which like update, fires when the containing component has been updated. But with the
              update hook it could get fired before the containing component's children are updated. The component
              updating method fires only after all children have been updated.</p>
            <p>And then the last hook is unbind, which gets called when the directive is unbound from its parent
              component.</p>
            <p>We're not going to demonstrate these three life cycle hooks in this course because they're much less
              common. The bind and update hooks are by far the most common. In fact, it's actually so common to use bind
              and update together that there is a shorthand for creating a directive that hooks into both the bind and
              update hooks. And since that's what our directive is doing let's change ours to shorthand syntax.</p>
            <p>So here instead of exporting an object we're going to export a function. And that function is going to
              take in the element and binding parameters:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-055.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-055</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and then the body of this is just going to be this function here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-056.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-056</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>so we'll cut this out here and paste it in here. And then we can delete the rest of this:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-057.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-057</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And we can delete our reply style function:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-058.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-058</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Cool, so you can see how this is much more to the point and a lot less ceremony going on in here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-059.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-059</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              And we are now binding to both the bind and update life cycle hooks. So this is a really common way to
              write directives. And that should still be working fine. So let's refresh this. And there we go:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-060.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-060</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Our directive is still working as expected. Alright, awesome. And that's how we create directives. Now
              let's go clean up this extra 30 pixels display here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-061.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-061</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We don't need that. There we go.:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-062.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-062</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Cool, so now let's go take a look at how to make directives available globally.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div><h3>Making Directives Available Globally</h3>
            <p>So far we've only been making our directive available to a single component by importing it here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-063.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-063</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              This is a good idea if the directive is really only related to a single component or just a couple of
              components. But often we'll want to create directives that we want to use throughout our app on lots of
              different components. When we do that it's better to declare the directive globally so we don't have to
              declare it in every component like we have here. So let's see how to do that with our pin directive. It's
              really quite easy.</p>

            <p>So we'll delete this directives section here and we'll delete the import:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-064.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-064</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And now of course if we look at our site that directive is no longer working:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-065.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-065</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Otherwise this would be pinned in the bottom right. And if we go look at the console, you can see that
              we're getting errors:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-066.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-066</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Failed to resolve directive pin, so our component doesn't know about this directive. So now let's go
              declare it globally. We just do that in our main.js file. So if I come in here, let's import our directive
              here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-067.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-067</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So import pin directive from shared pin directive. Okay now we can make our view application aware of
              this directive by just calling Vue.directive and then we will pass in our pin directive but first we have
              to give it a name. So this is the pin directive and then we pass in our imported pinDirective:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-068.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-068</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Cool, and that's it. This directive should now be available for use in all components in our app. So if we
              go check that out over here you can see we're no longer getting an error here and if we come over here,
              there we go. It's pinned to the bottom right:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-069.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-069</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Awesome, so directives are really quite simple to create and they can be really useful for sharing some
              functionality on elements around your site. Next let's take a look at using filters in view.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div><h3>Creating a Custom Filter</h3>
            <p>View filters allow you to easily transform data in your templates but sometimes the name can be a little
              misleading. Sometimes when we think of a filter we think of something that takes a list and filters out
              items from the list. While view filters can certainly be used to do that, that's not all they do.</p>
            <p>When you think of the word filter, maybe it's easy to compare them to a filter on a camera, which takes a
              photo and transforms the way it looks in some way. View filters do something similar for data. They take
              data in as input and output something different. To demonstrate how to create and use a filter let's
              create a currency filter.</p>
            <p>You could see here on our cart page that we're displaying the cost of each robot:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-070.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-070</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>But it's not formatted very nicely so we'll create a currency filter to format it. To do that we'll
              create a currency filter here in our shared folder. So I'm going to create a new file here and we'll call
              this currencyfilter.js:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-071.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-071</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And a filter is really just a function so we will export a function here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-072.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-072</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And a filter always has a minimum of one parameter and this is the input for the filter so we're going to
              specify amount here because this is a currency filter. And then our filter is just going to return a
              string. We'll use a string template here. And our string template is just going to pre pend a $ to the
              amount:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-073.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-073</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So this looks a little bit weird because we have two $$ but this is just the string template syntax and
              then we're pre pending a dollar sign here to this amount variable.</p>
            <p>And then we're just going to format this amount with two decimal points. So we'll just say to fixed here,
              pass in two decimal points:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-074.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-074</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Alright, now we can add this filter to our component like we did with directives. So over here in our
              shopping cart component we're going to import our currency filter from shared currency filter:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-075.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-075</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And then we'll just add a filter section and we'll add a currency filter and set that to our currency
              filter:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-076.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-076</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Alright now up here in our template we can use that right here inside this interpolation expression, so
              right after cost I'm going to add a pipe and then the name of our filter, so, currency:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-077.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-077</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So as you can see here the first parameter that has passed into the filter is the value that precedes the
              pipe. So robot.cost is going to be passed in as the first parameter of our currency filter. And then we'll
              just copy this here and paste it down here where we're showing the cost also:</p>

              <figcaption>Fig 06-078</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Okay that should do it. Let's go take a look. There we go. So we have our currency format here and if we
              add a robot that's on sale then that's getting formatted down here also:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-079.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-079</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Excellent. So that's formatting really nicely and that was really easy. But what if we wanted to be able
              to specify our currency symbol here? Right now we have it hard coded at the $. Well we could do that by
              passing a second parameter to our filter. So let's see how to do that.</p>
            <p>So back over here in our currency filter let's add a second parameter called symbol. And we'll use that
              down here instead of this $:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-080.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-080</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So we'll use another expression here, pass in symbol, and now that symbol is going to be pre pended to
              the amount. Alright, and if we go to take a look at that right now you can see that undefined as being pre
              pended to our amount:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-081.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-081</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and that's because we are not passing in a currency symbol yet. So back over in our template, we can just
              pass that in like this. So I'm going to pass in a $ here. And then we need to do the same thing up here so
              let's pass in the currency symbol here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-082.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-082</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Okay now if we take a look there we can see that we're getting a $ here. Or I can pass in another symbol
              like the British pound for example. So here on my U.S. keyboard I'm going to hold down alt and type in
              0163 on the numb pad and that gives me a £ and I'm just going to copy this and paste this down here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-083.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-083</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And now if I come over here, there we go. Now we have a £ sign.:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-084.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-084</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Yay so we now have a currency filter that takes in additional parameters. And of course you can do any
              type of data transformation you'd like with a filter since it just takes data in and returns data out. And
              since filters are just functions we can also just import them inside our component or anywhere else in our
              application and use them in a component like as a computer prop or whatever. They're just functions so we
              can use them however we want.</p>
            <p>Next let's take a look at how to declare this filter globally.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div><h3>Declaring Filters Globally</h3>
            <p>
              Just like we did with directives we can declare filters globally. Right now our currency filter is just
              imported and exposed only in our shopping cart component:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-085.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-085</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>But using a currency filter is pretty common and so we might want to use that elsewhere in our app. So
              let's declare it globally. So we'll start by removing this import here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-086.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-086</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and the filter here and then over in our main.js file we will import it. This changes a little bit:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-087.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-087</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And then just like we did with directives we can say view. filter and the first parameter is the filter
              name so currency and then we pass in our filter:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-088.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-088</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And that should do it. This currency filter is now available globally. So if we go back over to our app
              and add something to our cart, there we go:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig06-089.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 06-089</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Our currency filter is now working and it's being shared globally. So, awesome. Now we have a currency
              filter that we can use anywhere in our app.
            </p>

          <div><h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>In this module we learned about:</p>

              <li>Creating and using custom directives</li>
              <li>Passing data to directives</li>
              <li>Declaring directives locally vs. declaring them globally</li>

            </ul>
            <p>Now that we've explored all the fundamentals of building applications with Vue, let's explore how to
              build and deploy our app to production in our final module of this course.
