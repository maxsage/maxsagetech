            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              Hello and welcome to Vue. js: Big Picture. I'm Daniel Stern, also known as the Code Whisperer, and
              throughout this short course, I'll be walking you through everything that you need to know to become a Vue
              expert. While we won't be diving into detail in any of these topics, this will give you the context you
              need to pursue a full Vue education if you decide it's something you're interested in. Don't forget, if
              you want to get in touch, you can follow me on Twitter @danieljackstern.</p>
            <p>So what will we be discussing throughout this course? First, we'll understand exactly what Vue is, and
              we'll learn if it can help your business achieve its goals, whatever they may be. We'll get an overview of
              the core features that Vue developers have to know. We're not actually going to learn the ins and outs of
              all these features, but we will learn what they are. We'll also learn about the specific challenges Vue
              can help you solve. So if you have a particular coding problem down at the workplace, we'll learn if Vue
              is something that could help you with that or if not.</p>
            <p>In addition, we'll try to understand Vue relative to frameworks that we might already be familiar with.
              We'll compare it to a couple of frameworks like React and Angular and gain a bit more context on what it's
              all about. Finally, I'll advise you on some further resources that I think would be great for you to
              continue learning more about Vue when you complete this short course. In the next clip, we'll discuss the
              process of creating business solutions using Vue.

            <h3>
              Creating Business Solutions with Vue.js </h3>
            <p>
              I decided to begin this course not by discussing the technical aspects of Vue, but by discussing the
              business aspects. Can it solve the problems that your business has? Can through it solving those problems
              increase the revenue that your business earns? If it can increase the revenue of the business you own or
              work at, then there's a good argument that spending time to learn it and master it is not just fun and
              interesting, but a valuable way to spend time and a valuable skill to learn.</p>
            <figure>

              <figcaption>Fig 02-001</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>In this chart, the pie represents the total amount of commerce going through two different channels,
              Native App and Desktop &amp;
              Mobile. As we can see, the purple part, or the subset of the market where Vue is useful, is the one we're
              interested in. This chart shows us that of all the e-commerce being done, applications where Vue can get
              involved form a very large, in fact, a majority chunk of those.</p>
            <p>Currently, VUE doesn't have any use in the Native App domain. But in the future, Vue could have its own
              solution similar to React Native. Moreover, let's look at this quote from eMarketer. They said, "In 2017,
              retail e-commerce sales worldwide reached $2. 304 trillion. " And they also note that that's almost a 25%
              increase from the previous year. In other words, the data shows that there is, in fact, a very large
              amount of commerce going through the net and also through desktop applications like the kind that we make
              through Vue. But how does Vue interrelate to these e-commerce situations?</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig02-002.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 02-002</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So first of all, Vue apps can be built quickly, as we'll see, and the teams that build them don't have to
              be total experts. Of course, skill is good, but we'll also discuss that the skill level required to use
              Vue is fairly low compared to its rivals.</p>
            <p>In addition, Vue performs very quickly, and the package that Vue comes in, the library, is quite small.
              So when a user accesses your website on a mobile device, if it's not fast or if the library doesn't
              download fast enough, then it just won't work, and you won't make any money.</p>
            <p>Lastly, you can look at Vue as a toolset that contains everything you need to build the view layer for
              your application. So if you've built an application that sells widgets, and all the database stuff is
              taken care of, you're ready to go out there and sell it, Vue is everything you need to connect what the
              user sees to those back-end processes that makes the e-commerce happen.</p>
            <p>Finally, let's say you decide not to use a Vue. Maybe you use a different library or an ad-hoc solution
              of your own, maybe you just stick with good old-fashioned PHP and Java, what are the costs of that?</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig02-003.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 02-003</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              So as we discussed, if your page is too slow or the payload too big, mobile users will navigate away
              before anything has even loaded. You won't even have a chance to make your pitch, and there's data that
              supports this trend of the low, short attention span of these mobile users. So every time your framework
              of choice takes too long to load, you lose a potential sale. Vue is not perfect, but it is by far the
              smallest of the three frameworks, and thus loads the fastest.</p>

            <p>Next, drawing lists when you're dealing the DOM, or a Document Object Model, is a very expensive, slow
              operation. On mobile, redrawing a list that say has 10 or 12 elements can be so slow that the page can
              freeze altogether. Vue, similar to React and to Angular, uses what's called a virtual DOM. So when you
              update your list of 12 items, the actual change that happens to the DOM is minimized and it puts the least
              stress on the mobile device.</p>
            <p>Finally, let's say you're still using your existing ad-hoc solution. Let's just imagine it's a PHP
              application that's been developed for the past 10 years. When you want to make a change to the view layer
              if it's not made in an organized way or using a tool that I recommend, such as Vue, it may be disorganized
              and developers will take a long time to fix it. They will probably fix it eventually, but if there's a lot
              of disjointed code, then the result is it simply takes longer to deal with. Developer hours are very
              expensive, so if your developers are taking a long time to fix these Vue situations, it's going to affect
              the bottom line of your business.</p>
            <p>So I hope I've explained all the reasons why Vue can make sense for you accomplishing your business
              goals, whether it's to sell a product, or to share information, or simply to make a faster, better site to
              show off your own skills. Vue can definitely help you do it. Now the question you may have on your mind is
              why Vue? Why not something else? And that's a great question. We'll discuss that in the next clip.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div><h3>
            Why Vue? </h3>
            <p>
              So, why Vue? Why not a different framework? Why not anything? It's a fair question. And in addition to
              knowing the answer, if you, for example, suggest to your manager or your supervisor that you want to use
              Vue for a particular task, it would be very useful if you could explain why Vue yourself.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig02-004.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 02-004</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>As the Bard once penned, "Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust up
              them. " Well folks, you might say that React was born great, Angular achieved greatness, and Vue had
              greatness thrust upon it.</p>2
            <figure>
              <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig02-005.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 02-005</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>In the past, if you had a website problem that needed to be solved, something involving the view layer,
              something the user sees or clicked on, you'd probably reach for one of these libraries, jQuery, Angular,
              or React, and no one could blame you because they've been the standards for at least a decade. But now you
              may want to consider throwing that all out because Vue may, in fact, solve these problems better.</p>
            <p>So why would you use Vue?</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig02-006.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 02-006</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So first, and this is a big selling point, at least in my mind, Vue works for new or existing
              applications. If you have a new application that you're just getting started on, great, Vue works. But if
              you have an existing application, PHP, Angular, React, jQuery, you name it, you can start using Vue right
              away by targeting particular parts of the application that you want. In other words, Vue is not only
              useful for starting a brand-new application from scratch, it can be used to patch or improve applications
              you already have.</p>
            <p>Next, despite being a very new library, Vue is replete with features that are familiar to React and
              Angular developers. It's actually kind of interesting because Vue seems to combine a little bit of both.
              It has the virtual DOM of React with familiar directives of Angular, so no matter what your developer's
              background is, they're going to be able to apply at least a bit of their previous knowledge in working
              with Vue, and their learning process should be quite a bit faster.</p>
            <p>Another thing about Vue is, well, it's simple. Writing a Vue application feels just a bit simpler and
              easier than writing a React or Angular application. Thus, when a developer is tasked with fixing or
              upgrading a part of the application, the code that's written can be easily understood and the necessary
              fixes can be done fairly quickly. If you use Vue properly, you'll end up with an application where the
              component's logic, as well as its view and its connection to the overall data model are all in one logical
              place and easily repaired.</p>
            <p>Finally, Vue is popular. It's racked up over 100, 000 stars on GitHub, and I'm sure by the time you're
              watching this clip, it's many, many more. Developers everywhere have thrown out their adulatory stars and
              declared that they favor Vue. In fact, it's difficult to say since these numbers change all the time, but
              in terms of GitHub stars, Vue may be more popular than React or Angular, maybe even more popular than both
              put together.</p>
            <p>A popular library is likely to have many contributors. Large bugs are likely to be found quickly and
              addressed promptly. There are disadvantages, of course, such as if you want to put forward a pull request
              or open issue, it may be lost in the noise of such a vibrant library. But you can assure your supervisor,
              your manager, anyone, that Vue is not just a fly-by-night library. It's a big deal on the net and
              supported by some very serious people.</p>
            <p>Speaking of serious people, let's ask the question who uses Vue? Is the kind of team that uses Vue
              similar at all to your team? Well, it probably is.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig02-007.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 02-007</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So the first kind of group that can use Vue is a small team or even an individual that's creating a
              prototype or a small application. Vue really shines when you're making prototypes, in other words, a small
              sliver of an application which is interactive, it can have a click or an animation, but can exist on its
              own and doesn't really interact with the back end, at least not seriously. As we'll discover, Vue is very
              good for prototypes, and of React, Angular, and Vue, is probably the best at making things that are small.
            </p>
            <p>Now if you're collaborating on a large web application, then Vue can still be useful. Since Vue breaks up
              so many parts of the view into different components, it makes collaboration easy. That's not to say that
              you can't use a different framework, but in my opinion for new projects that are anywhere between small
              and large, Vue is the best. For projects that are bigger than that like huge or gigantic, then React or
              Angular might actually make more sense.</p>
            <p>Finally, individual contractors, people from outside of the company that come into fix a particular
              problem, these people really can take advantage of Vue. So as a simple example, let's say you have a very
              old, but profitable e-commerce site, and you want to add a new kind of currency to the checkout page. The
              checkout page is written in PHP, and your current PHP developer tells you that the new currency will take
              a month to add and cost you about $7000.00. But what can you do? That's just how it's done.</p>
            <p>Well, you might call in a contractor to just replace the whole part of that site with something that can
              be fixed and updated more cheaply and easily. The contractor you'd hire would be very likely to simply
              take that one part of the page and replace it with its own Vue application while keeping the rest of the
              application intact. Vue is very good for these kinds of spot fixes that involve fixing one part of a
              website without fixing another. Thus, most everyone can use Vue given the right circumstances.</p>
            <p>Now the last thing you're probably wondering is can I use Vue? Do I meet the minimum requirements of
              background knowledge and skill? Well, luckily, you probably do already.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig02-008.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 02-008</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So first, you'll need a basic knowledge of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Nothing too fancy and certainly
              much, much, much less than you'd need to use React or Angular. But if you don't even know what one of
              these things is, if you've never used HTML before, then you probably need to do a bit of learning before
              you can tackle Vue. Pluralsight has excellent courses on JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, so that's a great
              place to get started.</p>
            <p>You need a text editor, which is not a big hurdle to get over. I personally prefer WebStorm, but WebStorm
              costs about $200. 00 to purchase. Atom is comparable and is free. Both work with Vue.</p>
            <p>And finally, to work with your Vue application, you need some way to get a local server going. You can
              use a familiar solution like Apache or HTTP server, although Vue has its own solution called Vue CLI,
              which we'll talk about a little bit later.</p>
            <p>So by now, you should have a good idea of why you would use Vue. In the next clip, we'll talk about what
              Vue is.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div><h3>
            What Is Vue? </h3>
            <p>
              So, what is Vue? It's a funny question actually. I'm sure that a percentage of the audience watching this
              will think that this is a painfully obvious question and do not want to spend any further time discussing
              it, and I'm sure another large segment of the audience is very happy I'm explaining this because it can be
              a very difficult question to answer.</p>
            <p>What is Vue? Is it an idea, a block of code, a tool? It turns out, it's all these things.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig02-009.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 02-009</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So if you take away all the metaphor, and symbolism, and context out of Vue, Vue is a JavaScript library.
              Take a little more context out of that, and it's just a big block of JavaScript code. That's what it is.
              More specifically, it's code that you run before any code you write, and it gives context to the code that
              you write by taking words that you type into JavaScript, like Vue, and making those functions instead of
              just undefined words.</p>
            <p>Now if we looked inside that big block of code that is Vue, we'd see the instructions for making a render
              engine, which is something that takes data as a model, you can imagine it as a JavaScript object, and it
              outputs HTML, which is something that a browser can take and turn into something a user sees.</p>
            <p>And finally, in a more abstract sense, it's a collaboration tool, which allows you to break an
              application up into smaller segments, which lets more than one person work on them. This is done through
              components.</p>
            <p>So what are the core features, the features that make Vue Vue?</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig02-010.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 02-010</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Vue has versatile components. If you're not familiar with components, they're small, little bundles of
              JavaScript HTML which can be composed. In other words, you can take a component and put it inside another
              component, and put several components into that one, and they all make this nice, easy hierarchy of your
              application, in theory. Vue's components are simple to use and have all the features that the components
              of React and Angular have minus maybe a few of the more specific ones.</p>
            <p>Vue also has built-in reactivity. Reactivity, which I also like to call magic, is the special quality
              which causes the application, what you see, to update automatically when the data layer changes. Even
              though you didn't call any calls to change the DOM or even tell it to update, it just kind of knows. This
              is a really cool feature, but as we'll learn a little bit later, not without its downsides.</p>
            <p>As we mentioned, Vue is a small library, it loads quickly, and it's designed to render your application
              fast. No bells, no whistles, just speed. And time and time again, we've seen that speed in applications on
              the web correlates exactly to how much profit you make relative to how much profit you could make in a
              perfect world.</p>
            <p>Finally, Vue comes with many directives such as for, if, or bind prefixed with the word v that anyone
              who's worked with Angular, or React, or even Knockout will probably be familiar with.</p>
            <p>So let's discuss Vue's proprietary file type called the. vue file. This is a feature that's unique to Vue
              over React and Angular, though they have their own file that you might see only in a React project, none
              of those use the. vue file. That's only a Vue application.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig02-011.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 02-011</figcaption>

            <p>So loosely, a. vue file is like a big conglomeration of HTML, CSS, and JS, they can all fit in the file
              together; however, Vue files can't be read by web browsers. If you try to open your. vue file in Chrome,
              it will say that an unrecognized file was opened. So you have to have a build step when you choose to use.
              vue files; otherwise, you don't need to have one.</p>
            <p>Build steps are useful, but also long and confusing. In other words, it's safe to consider a build step
              as a sacrifice you have to make to use. vue files. They're pretty useful though, so some might consider it
              worth it.</p>
            <p>The main advantage of the. vue file is that it allows all the code for a single component to be in one
              file, but it allows you to do this without writing any pseudocode like, for example, HTML templates in
              JavaScript or anything like that. To help understand, let's look at a sample Vue file.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig02-012.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 02-012</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now a. vue file consists of three sections, which I'll explain in a moment. There's the template section,
              the script section, and the style section. What are these sections?</p>
            <p>So the template section contains HTML. Here you can see a single paragraph tag that I've decided is going
              to be my component. You'll also notice the curly brackets. We can use interpolation, whether it's
              handlebar styles like this or various different kinds of binding, within the template.</p>
            <p>The script section contains the application code. Whatever the module's exports are becomes the
              controller for the template that we've defined above it.</p>
            <p>Here we're defining the data. And the number 42, if we were to render this component, would appear in the
              message slot above</p>
            <p> Finally, the simplest section, styles, contains styles that are scoped to this component. So the
              paragraph that I've colored blue here will only apply to this component and not to components or tags that
              are located outside of this. vue file.</p>
            <p>.Vue files are fairly simple and easy to use. With this initial explanation adding context to your
              learning, I'm sure you'll find them very useful and simple.</p>
            <p>So now that we understand what Vue is, where can Vue be found? How can we take Vue and put it on our
              computers or in our projects? So first of all, you can find Vue on its GitHub where you can contribute or
              create issues, as well as download the source code.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig02-013.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 02-013</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So here I am at the Vue GitHub page, which you can access at the URL at the top. This is basically the
              headquarters for anything and all things Vue. As you can see, since I've started making this course, it's
              already clawed its way up to almost 108, 000 stars, so this is obviously a very fast-growing library.
              Here, if you're interested, you can see the raw source code for Vue. This is a lot for anyone except a
              serious power user to take in, but it's there if you're interested.</p>
            <p>If you have an issue with Vue, like some particular bug you found, you can click the Issues button and
              create a new issue. You can also see the issue discussions that people are having, which is a great way to
              see into the future of Vue.</p>
            <p>Last but not least, you can just download the Vue source code here by clicking on this and following the
              instructions. Next, you can download the library from a CDN, or a content delivery network, or from
              npm.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig02-014.png"/>

            </figure>
            <p>
              So here I am with my terminal window open. I've opened it into an empty folder so that when I install
              these files, I won't put them in a directory with a bunch of stuff that's already in it. In order to
              install Vue this way, you need npm installed. If you type npm and don't see any error, then you know you
              have npm installed. If you do, you can get Vue into your project directory just by typing npm install vue,
              and just like that, it installs. And if I check out my directory, node_modules has been created, and if we
              look inside, Vue has been installed. We're now free to use Vue in any application in this directory we
              want.</p>

              <figcaption>Fig 02-015</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Finally, you can look at the documentation at vuejs. org. The Vue. js documentation is widely applauded
              by the community as just being some really great documentation. You can click the Learn button and get
              started by reading the Guide. Now if your goal is to go beyond anything that's a junior Vue developer, if
              you want to be intermediate or better, I do recommend that you read the Vue documentation and get a good
              understanding of the total depth of the discussion. There are also great courses that are available, which
              will provide valuable content to help you understand these docs. But at the end of the day, the docs are,
              in a sense, the context, so you should still have a good look at them.</p>
            <p>So it looks like we've answered the question what is a Vue? In the next clip, we'll be discussing what
              Vue can do and also what Vue cannot do.
