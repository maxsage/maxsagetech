            <p> I sure have had fun putting this course together. Comparing Vue to React and Angular in so many
              different ways has really increased my appreciation of the JavaScript ecosystem. Let's quickly review the
              main points of what we've discussed in this short course.</p>

            <p>So Vue is fast, it's lightweight, and it's easy to use. These are all things that relate to convenience,
              and Vue is just kind of the most convenient of the frameworks.</p>
            <p>Of course, stark contrast would not be correct because Vue has much in common with both Angular and
              React. At the end of the day, you might say that its goals are the same, but it tries to do it in a more
              simple fashion.</p>
            <p>In addition to helping us make a performant and maintainable application, components are very useful when
              we want to split work up among our team of developers.</p>
            <p>We learned that Vue works without a build step, but that this is better reserved for prototypes, and for
              serious production applications, we can use Vue with a build step.</p>
            <p>Lastly, we've learned that Vue is not the whole story. It has a vibrant ecosystem of supporting
              libraries. Without that ecosystem, Vue really only renders the view layer, takes our data model, mixes it
              with our components, and spits out HTML. Ninety percent of the time, you don't have to think of Vue as
              being any more complicated than that.</p>
            <p>Finally, let's summarize the advantages of Vue. By knowing the advantages well, you will be qualified to
              decide if Vue is the right library for any given task that you have.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Vue has a small package size. It downloads faster than React or Angular, making it good for mobile.</p>
            <p>Vue can omit a build step when necessary, allowing you to prototype quickly, but also allowing you to
              bring it into production by adding that build step.</p>
            <p>The Vue API, which features HTML directives, is familiar to any developers who have worked with Angular.
            </p>
            <p>The command-line tools allow us to construct our Vue applications in such a way that the structure will
              be familiar to the whole team. Due to its various advantages, it should be your first choice when it comes
              to prototyping a new feature.</p>
            <p>Having fewer features than React or Angular makes Vue easier to learn and to use.</p>
            <p>And lastly, a vibrant community of open-source developers supports Vue, so you can rely on timely updates
              and bug fixes.</p>
            <p>So assuming I've convinced you that learning more about Vue is a good way to spend your time, what can
              you do next?</p>

            <p>First, check out Vue. js Fundamentals by Jim Cooper, here on Pluralsight. You can find the course at the
              URL displayed on the screen. As you can see, unlike this brief overview, View. js Fundamentals spends over
              5 hours getting into the nitty gritty of how to use Vue. It's an excellent follow up to this course.</p>
            <p>This covers all the important topics that I would cover in a Vue course including components, template
              syntax, directives, and communicating with other components. It even teaches you about Vuex. Very cool.
            </p>
            <p>I'd also like to recommend that you check out Vue. js: Getting Started by Chad Campbell. This is a course
              that might be more suitable for beginners. Not only is it a beginner-level course with a shorter duration,
              but it covers various topics that I would say, while being equally important, are more fundamental to
              using Vue. This course goes into much greater detail on the basic topics such as templates, simple user
              events, and the rendering of lists. If you're a beginner JavaScript developer or have very little
              knowledge of Vue, React, or Angular, I'd say this is a terrific course to check out next.</p>
            <p>Finally, we're always coming up with new courses, so check back at Pluralsight frequently for brand-new
              Vue. js courses that cover the latest cutting-edge topics.</p>
            <p> I'd like to wrap this course up with a big thank you to you for watching. This course wasn't the
              longest, and it wasn't the most difficult to get through, but hey, it still takes time and commitment to
              take a few hours out of your day that you could be doing anything you want to spend time with me learning
              this course. So I hope that it's been as enriching for you as it has for me, and I look forward to seeing
              you in my next great course here at Pluralsight. You have a good day. </p>
