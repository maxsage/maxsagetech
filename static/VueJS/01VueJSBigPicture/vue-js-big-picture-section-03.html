            <h2>Why Use Vue.js? </h2>
            <div>
              <h3> Vue Capabilities and Limitations </h3>
              <p> In this clip, we'll be discussing Vue's capabilities and limitations. After all, my goal is not to get
                you to use Vue under any circumstances. I don't get any special reward at the end of the day if you
                decide to use Vue or React. I just honestly do believe that Vue is the best tool for many situations.
                Many, but not all. So, let's have a look.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-001.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-001</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>So what are said capabilities and limitations? We'll be looking at what Vue does and what Vue does not
                do.</p>
              <p>So first, what Vue does. So it outputs HTML code, browsers can read this HTML code, and users see
                something at the end of the day. Simple enough. Vue also, similar to any front-end framework, maps the
                interactions that your user makes, hovering or clicking, to JavaScript methods that you write, which
                may, for example, contact your server and make a payment.</p>
              <p>Vue does use sophisticated techniques similar to React and Angular to speed the rendering of the
                application. So when you, say, have a list of 20 items and replace them with a list of another 20 items,
                clever substitutions are made so that the device that it's being viewed on re-renders as little as
                possible, and this actually makes a huge difference on slow devices like mobile phones.</p>
              <p>In addition, as long as you don't use the. vue file, Vue works in most browsers, modern browsers,
                without any build step at all. If you're like me and not a huge fan of the extra complexity that build
                steps bring, you'd think this is a very cool feature, especially for prototypes or applications with
                limited scope.</p>
              <p>Now there's stuff that Vue doesn't do.</p>
              <p>So Vue doesn't create a server for your application. The exception is if you use Vue CLI as well since
                Vue CLI can make a server, but that runs on npm, and we're talking about a whole different stack of
                dependencies, so you may not want to go down that route, in which case you'll need a different solution
                like Apache to actually serve your application.</p>
              <p>Vue doesn't test your code for errors. You still have to do that yourself. If you write code that's
                wrong, Vue will still try to run it.</p>
              <p>Unlike Angular, it doesn't have a lot of utility methods. There aren't many pipes, and currency
                converters, and language support built in. It's just Vue. You have to use its complimentary library,
                which we'll be spending quite a bit of time discussing, to give it any utility; otherwise, without these
                libraries, you'd just have to look at it as something that takes a model and outputs HTML code.</p>
              <p>In addition, it doesn't do routing, which is where what the URL in the browser is affects what you see.
                You, once again, need to use a complimentary library, vue-router, to get this working. And unlike
                Angular, Vue does not have its own module solutions, so you're still going to be using ES6 modules for
                your Vue app. </p>

            <div>
              <h3> Reactivity and Vue </h3>
              <p> In this clip, we'll discuss reactivity and Vue. This is an important topic since reactivity is one of
                the main problems that Vue sets out to solve. So what is reactivity? Basically, reactivity is the way an
                application changes what the user sees in response to any kind of activity, for example, the user
                hitting a button, or putting text into an input, or activity coming from the server, like a message
                that's been sent via AJAX. Here's a simple example.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-002.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-002</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Imagine in your application you have a simple array representing a list of your favorite fruits. The
                array contains the items apples and pears. On the right is what a user might see. Now imagine we add a
                new item to this list, let's say grapes. As our data model on the left is updated, we see that our
                application on the right also updates. But why is this all important?</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-003.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-003</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>So JavaScript doesn't have any built-in solution for reactivity. That's why libraries like Vue,
                Angular, and React exist to fill this gap in the features that JavaScript provides automatically.</p>
              <p>It's a good thing that we have these frameworks too because if not implemented correctly, reactivity is
                very slow, easily the slowest part of any application.</p>
              <p>Vue solves this problem, and moreover, it doesn't solve it in the exact same way as say Angular or
                React, lending to its validity as a possible alternative to those libraries.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-004.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-004</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>So when you're working with a Vue application, how should you expect it to handle reactivity? So Vue
                detects the changes to the data automatically, and then what the user sees is updated automatically, and
                they're able to continue interacting with the application.</p>
              <p>In other words, with Vue, reactivity is completely automatic. Compare this to React when, for example,
                you might need to call render in order for your application's view to match its data model.</p>
              <p>Moreover, Vue reuses DOM elements and also uses other special techniques to make the performance of
                these updates very fast.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-005.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-005</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>So we've talked about it in theory, but what does this really mean, both for a developer and for a
                user? </p>
              <p>First, let's talk about how Vue's reactivity relates to a developer. Code is easier to write and
                maintain since you don't have to explicitly tell Vue every time you want to render something. Vue uses a
                virtual DOM to make large updates fast, and it allows you, as a programmer, to express those updates in
                less code. Since you have less code, it's easier to find and fix bugs. But how did this all impact your
                end user?</p>
              <p> Well to your end user, the application is fast and fun to use. Even if they're working with a huge
                list, let's say this is a really popular guy, and they have 1000 people on their friends list, no matter
                how big a list, the application doesn't seem to go any slower. Finally, the user simply experiences
                fewer bugs as they're using your application. Pretty good.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, reactivity and Vue do have some challenges. I find that this is because Vue tries to
                make everything so automatic that there's some situations that arise that are just difficult to resolve.
                So as we found, Vue components update automatically when the underlying data changes. This is really
                simple if the underlying data is a number, or a string, or a Boolean, or an immutable data structure. In
                JavaScript, the immutable data structures are numbers, strings, and Booleans, and the mutable data
                structures are arrays and objects. And if an array of objects represents your data, then reactivity is
                not so simple.</p>
              <p> Because of the way modern JavaScript works, Vue's automatic detection methods, let's just say they
                work inconsistently with arrays and objects. Sometimes they're able to determine the array has been
                updated, and sometimes they simply aren't aware, and you're Vue app will not update when you expect it
                to. As you become more experienced with Vue, you will learn techniques that sort of indicate to Vue that
                the data has changed. But I really wanted to warn you about this now, because inevitably, if you go deep
                into Vue, you are going to encounter this challenge where, for example, having an object will make your
                application not work the way that you expect, and now you'll know that the solution involves
                understanding reactivity and mutable objects.</p>
              <p>In the next clip, we'll jump right into a sample Vue application and see how they really work. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3> A Simple Vue Application </h3>
              <p> I felt that simply talking about Vue without having any kind of Vue application would be too thin of a
                discussion, so I've put together a simple Vue application for us to look at. Now I do mean simple
                because I wanted the application to be fully understandable in under 5 minutes, so I have pulled out all
                the stops and created the simplest thing I could.</p>
              <p>So we'll be looking at a basic to-do list application. It's you'll take things you want to do, you add
                them to the list, you check them off. It's the most common trope of examples in computer programming. As
                we look at it, you're going to want to take note of the following things. We don't need any build step
                to run our application, the file size is very, very small, and we're using a content delivery network to
                download Vue, which means we don't need npm, and if Vue's already been downloaded by the user from the
                same CDN on a different website, it'll actually load up instantly, which is terrific.</p>
              <p>So first, let's look at the app. The app is available at <a
                  href="danielstern.ca/vue">danielstern.ca/vue </a>, so let's go over there now.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-006.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-006</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>I now have my sample Vue application open on the left along with the repository, which contains all the
                code, on the right. So if you'd like to get this application running on your own computer, you can
                install it from the GitHub repository and follow the instructions in the Installation section.</p>
              <p>First, let's have a look at what this application does. It's a basic TodoMVC, or to-do
                Model-View-Controller, application.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-007.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-007</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>You can click any of these items, which will toggle their completeness, and you can toggle this global
                Show Completed setting, which will hide or show the items that have been completed.</p>
              <p>Finally, you can add new items. It's not an incredibly complex application, but it's a nice microcosm
                of what we might see in a full-sized production app. Let's look at the code that make all this possible.
              </p>
              <p> Let's start by looking at index.html.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-008.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-008</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>So what we see here at the top is the structure of a normal application. We see the title, a link to
                Bootstrap, and a link to our own styles, which we'll investigate in a minute. The first interesting
                thing we'll run into is this div with the ID app.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-009.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-009</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>There's nothing in it, but when a Vue runs, you'll define an element that it should kind of bootstrap
                or put the application into. In this case, the div with the ID of app is our such element.</p>
              <p>The next interesting thing is this script tag.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-010.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-010</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Now Vue has some interesting ways of dealing with templates, and one of the ways is that you can put a
                template inside the HTML file. Now this isn't a great way to organize a Vue application if it has more
                than one component, but in the case of my small Vue, TodoMVC, it was just right. So this code inside
                here is actual Vue template code.</p>
              <p>First you'll notice, on line 26, you'll see this attribute, v-on:click.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-011.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-011</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Vue uses HTML directives similar to Angular to coordinate activity. So in this case, v-on:click means
                that the expression in the quotes afterwards will execute whenever the click event occurs.</p>
              <p>Here, you can see the v-model property on the checkbox.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-012.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-012</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>So when I click this checkbox here:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-013.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-013</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>The property of the model known as showComplete is changing to match whether it's checked or not. This
                code here represents the list of items.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-014.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-014</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Here, we can see a repeater, or an element that repeats itself for every item in an array. You can see
                it uses the v-for directive, which may be familiar to anyone who's used Angular as being almost
                identical to the ngFor directive, and whatever is inside this list item will be repeated for every
                element of the array.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-015.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-015</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Finally, you can see some interpolation:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-016.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-016</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Inside these double curly brackets is a statement, a JavaScript statement, that says todo. name. So
                where the text of the actual Todo appears is directly equivalent to this line of code containing
                {{todo.name}}. If you're working at home, you can try it by, for example, adding the word hello, and
                you'll see that hello will now appear before each one of these elements.</p>
              <p>Finally, a form allows us to submit a new Todo. Notice this form is using the v-on directive as well,
                but it's listening to the submit event.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-017.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-017</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Finally, at the bottom, you can notice that we're including Vue via a script tag.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-018.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-018</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>This means that there's no build step and getting our application to actually be a prototype is a bit
                easier. </p>
              <p>Next, let's take a quick look at our styles. css. As you can see, there's not a whole lot here.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-019.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-019</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p> Most of the styles are handled by bootstrap, which is compatible with Vue. You can see the. completed
                style, which we are applying conditionally to certain elements of our application. Finally, let's look
                at app. js.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-020.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-020.png</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Here, on line 11, you can see our data model. Our application's data model is literally an array.</p>
              <p>On line 25, you can see us actually initialize the Vue application. This is done with the syntax new
                Vue. We define an element, as I pointed out, our app element in our index file, and our template, which
                we also had a look at. That's also in the index file. The data method returns our application's data
                model:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-021.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-021</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Here are todos, as well as an empty text string, which will correspond to our input here, and the
                showComplete property.</p>
              <p>The computed properties of our configurations work in the same way as data, but it's data that needs to
                be processed beforehand.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-022.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-022</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Here you can see the filteredTodos property, which is all the todos in the list, but without those that
                are complete. Computed properties are calculated differently than regular properties. The general idea
                is that they save processing power.</p>
              <p>Finally, we can see the methods that we've defined for our Vue application:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-023.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-023</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>There's just one, addTodo, which is called whenever this form is submitted. You'll notice all we do is
                push our new Todo item to the array of todos that we have, and then Vue handles the update
                automatically. This goes back to the reactivity that we're talking about.</p>
              <p>So that's the application. It has some interesting properties. I think it's very cool how declarative
                our app. js file is and how much of the logic we were actually able to put into the template. So that's
                all the time I have to show you this application, but I do encourage you to copy it onto your computer,
                get it started, and make a few changes in the code base to see how each and every line works. So that's
                all the time I have to discuss this simple app I've made, but there's so much more in my comments for
                you to read and become familiar with. So go ahead, clone it, modify it, change the values, add new
                features, and take some time to get familiar with it. After you're satisfied with that, join us again.
              </p>
              <p>And in the next clip, we'll be discussing the question of where should you use Vue? </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3> Where Should You Use Vue? </h3>
              <p> As we've seen so far, Vue is a powerful framework with many interesting features, but all front-end
                challenges are not created equal. There are some jobs that Vue just makes more sense for than others, so
                let's discuss that.</p>
              <p>So what's a good scenario to use Vue in? Well, an off sided and good example is modernizing a legacy
                application, so taking an app that's old and works, but is slow, and maybe isn't compatible with
                everything you want it to be, and bringing it up to modern standards. Additionally, Vue makes it very
                easy to build applications as a team, which we'll discuss in a moment. Finally, Vue is perhaps the best
                choice out of all the major frameworks for the process of prototyping. Let's dive a bit further into
                these three things.</p>
              <p>First, let's talk about modernizing legacy applications. Legacy applications are extremely common as
                all an application needs to do to become a legacy application is to stick around for 10 or 15 years
                without breaking; however, these older apps tend to be very difficult to upgrade and maintain. So how
                could we use a Vue to fix this situation?</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-024.PNG" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-024</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>So probably the best part is that a Vue can be included incrementally. In other words, you can just
                replace a small part of the application, the most critical part, with a small Vue app. In this scenario,
                the rest of the application will continue to function the same, and you'd go about a process of slowly,
                but incrementally replacing the application with Vue components.</p>
              <p>In this way, we can also preserve the structure of the existing application as we modernize it. This is
                good because in very old, fragile applications, even the tiniest structural change could break the whole
                thing.</p>
              <p>Now even if an application is not so old as if it's built with React, or Angular, or jQuery, Vue will
                still be helpful in these situations as it integrates nicely into applications that are built with these
                frameworks.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, this is good because using Vue to update your legacy application lets you show
                results right away. As soon as you've fixed a particular problem area, you can push the changes, and in
                that particular area, performance and maintainability will be improved.</p>
              <p>Now you might wonder when is the right time to modernize your application? Well, as William Shakespeare
                said</p>
              <blockquote>"Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valiant never taste of death but once."
              </blockquote>
              <p><cite>William Shakespeare, Julius Caesar</cite></p>
              <p>In other words, the longer you wait to modernize your application, the more trouble you're going to
                have. So here's a quick checklist to see if you should modernize your application.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-025.PNG" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-025</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>First are simple changes, especially just cosmetic ones to what the users see. Do those changes take a
                long time? And are they so unusually complicated that for some reason only your most senior and
                experienced developers can handle them?</p>
              <p>When the boss of the company requests a new feature in the view layer, do the senior developers say
                that they simply cannot do it because implementing it would be too hard or it might break something
                else? Do you hear this a lot while working on your project?</p>
              <p>Finally, is the code of the application all ad hoc? In other words, is there no guiding principle or
                unifying strategy that ties the whole application together? If it is, then when you have a new developer
                coming in, they're going to have to relearn everything from the ground up, whereas if you use something
                like Vue, new recruits are usually already familiar with the conventions used in React, Angular, and
                Vue. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3> Building Applications as a Team and Prototyping with Vue </h3>
              <p> The next area where it makes sense to use Vue is when you have a team and you're all building an
                application together. Now I know that you can also use React and Angular for this purpose, but we'll be
                comparing React and Angular directly to Vue a bit later. So for now, let's just look at Vue's benefits
                specifically when we're working with a team.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-026.PNG" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-026</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>So the main feature of Vue, as we've seen, is components, and components allow us to separate the
                different parts of our app into different bodies of work. This makes it easy for two different
                developers to work on two different parts of the app.</p>
              <p>In addition,. vue files give us a convenient way to separate our CSS, our HTML, and our JavaScript, but
                keep them in the same file. As the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can't be mixed, but have to be in their own
                distinct part of the Vue file, it makes it easy to check these changes in with source control and
                multiple different developers can work on the same Vue file.</p>
              <p>Another advantage, which I've pointed out, is that a lot of people, and this proportion of people is
                growing every day, are already familiar with Vue. By the time you're done with this course, you'll be
                somewhat familiar with Vue as well. Thus, if you've been building an extremely by the books Vue app and
                you bring someone else in, they should be able to jump in with minimal assistance. Very cool.</p>
              <p>Finally, when it comes time for your application to really evolve and become a big, full-featured
                application, the ecosystem that Vue has, the accompanying libraries, provide the tooling that you need
                to make it happen. So as we'll discuss later, you can use Vue's ecosystem libraries to facilitate
                routing, or state management, or all the bigger challenges that you're going to face when you build this
                app.</p>
              <p> Finally, let's talk about prototyping. I've saved the best for last because prototyping is really
                where Vue shines above React and Angular.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig03-027.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 03-027</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>So Vue can be set up very quickly. If you go with the most basic setup, as in using the Vue script from
                a CDN, then there's basically no set up at all. You can get started 5 minutes after your supervisor or
                boss has requested the prototype. But even in a prototype, Vue is still fast. So if your prototype
                involves say a list of 100 elements or 1000 elements, if you just wrote it in plain HTML or jQuery,
                you'd probably get a bit of slowdown, esp</p>
              <p> Finally, there's not a big difference between how you'd make a Vue prototype and how you'd make a real
                Vue app. Thus, if your prototype is a hit, it's very simple to take that prototype and turn it into a
                full application or compose it into your existing Vue components. So those are all the things you can do
                with Vue. As you can see, the list is not short, and it's a very useful library. In the next clip, we'll
                be discussing the Vue ecosystem, or those libraries that let you do things that with just Vue you
                cannot. </p>
