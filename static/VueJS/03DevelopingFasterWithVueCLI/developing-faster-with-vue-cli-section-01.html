              <h3>Course Overview</h3>
              <p>Hi everyone. My name is John Papa. Welcome to my course, Developing Faster with the Vue CLI. I'm a web
                architect and JavaScript developer expert, and I'm very excited to share this course with you. This
                course gently introduces how to create, debug, test, build, serve, and extend Vue applications using the
                Vue CLI and popular Vue developer tools.</p>
              <p>You will learn how to hone your Vue skills and develop great apps quickly. Some of the major topics
                that we will cover include</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Creating and customizing a new Vue application</li>
                <li>Building Vue apps, libraries and web components</li>
                <li>Debugging Vue applications with Chrome and Visual Studio Code</li>
                <li>Extending your Vue app with Vue CLI plugins such as Vuex, ESLint, and Progressive Web Apps
                <li>learning the Vue CLI's UI, a graphical user interface for interacting with the Vue CLI</li>
              </ul>
              <p>By the end of this course, you'll have learned these concepts and more, and be well on your way to
                building Vue apps. Before beginning this course, you should be familiar with JavaScript, but you don't
                have to be an expert by any means. Please join me on this journey to learn the Vue CLI, with the
                Developing Faster with the Vue CLI course, on Pluralsight. We hope you enjoy it. </p>
