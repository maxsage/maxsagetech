            <h2>Creating a Vue Application</h2>
            <div>
              <h3>Application Creation Concepts</h3>
              <p>As developers, when we start to build a new application, so many thoughts go through our heads when we
                stare at that blank screen. What files am I going to create? What features do I need? Are there any
                settings I want to have right out of the gate? What's the folder structure going to look like? Vue CLI
                can help answer all of these for us, which is great.</p>
              <p>So in this module, we're going to walk through creating a Vue application. Sometimes we need to get it
                started quickly, and we'll learn the options that we can do to get out of the gate fast, and then we're
                going to look through all the different creation options because there's so many creation options for
                creating a brand-new project.</p>
              <p>When we walk through using the Vue CLI, it's going to ask us a lot of questions. These are called
                prompts. We'll learn what these prompts are and how we can save and share and then reuse these favorite
                answers of ours from the prompts. By the end of this module, you'll have mastered how to customize the
                Vue CLI to generate new projects just the way you need them. </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              <h3>Learning the Application Creation Options</h3>
              <p>Learning the different options for creating Vue apps is an important part of using the Vue CLI. The
                first step when using many of these commands is to look at the help flag. So we just type in:</p>
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue create --help</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 04-001</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>it will tell us all the many options that come with vue create and what the default settings are and
                what they all do. When we generate a new Vue app, there's a couple commands that you need to learn, the
                first to which is the vue create. So we can say:</p>
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue create hello-vue</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 04-002</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>and if we do this by default and hit Enter, we'll follow the prompts after this to create an
                application. We'll learn more about those prompts in an upcoming section. We've seen a few times now we
                can do:</p>
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue create hello-vue -d</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 04-003</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>or</p>
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue create hello-vue --default</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 04-004</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>This will use the default settings and create a Vue application. Basically, it won't ask us any
                questions, it'll just create the app for us with some very intelligent defaults. Another option we can
                do is:</p>
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue create hello-vue -db</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 04-005</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>We're combining two different aliases now for both defaults and creating a bare project. That's what
                the b stands for. What's a bare project? This means instead of having the Vue app come up with a bunch
                of links and helpful quick starts, none of those will be there because when you build an application,
                you're probably not going to want all of those things on your page, but when you're first starting out,
                they're kind of helpful.</p>
              <p>We just learned about an alias there for -d and for -b. So let's take a step back and learn what these
                do. Two dashes prefix the options normally, so --default, just like this here:</p>
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue create hello-vue --default</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 04-006</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>but we can also use a single dash with d to alias as shortcut. In this case:</p>
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue create hello-vue -d</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 04-007</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>-d stands for default. Notice here that the first character of default is d, and that happens to be the
                alias. That's a convention when available, but it isn't always the case because sometimes d can only be
                used once. Let's take a look at some of these here. Here are some common vue create options:</p>
              <table class="table">
                <thead>
                  <tr>
                    <th>Options</th>
                    <th>Alias</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                  </tr>
                </thead>
                <tr>
                  <td>--default</td>
                  <td>-d</td>
                  <td>Use the defaults (no prompts)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>--bare</td>
                  <td>-b</td>
                  <td>Scaffold without beginner instructions</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>--packageManager</td>
                  <td>-m</td>
                  <td>Use npm or yarn</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>--registry</td>
                  <td>-r</td>
                  <td>url of npm registry</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>--proxy</td>
                  <td>-x</td>
                  <td>Use a proxy when creating the app</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>--no-git</td>
                  <td>-n</td>
                  <td>Skip git initialization</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>--preset</td>
                  <td>-p</td>
                  <td>Skip prompts and use a preset</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>--help</td>
                  <td>-h</td>
                  <td>Output usage information</td>
                </tr>
              </table>
              <p>We learned about default, which is just -d. We also saw a -b earlier where we can scaffold without the
                beginner instructions. That stands for bare.</p>
              <p>Package manager is -m. This is do you want to use npm or Yarn at this time? Notice that the -m is not
                the first letter of the option, which is p. This is what I meant earlier when it's not always the first
                letter of the option. So, keep in mind the aliases are shortcuts, but if you forget those, you can
                always do:</p>
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue create --help</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 04-008</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>to see them. If you want to change your registry, maybe you've got an internal one you have to point to
                your own npm registry, you can use -r, or --registry. If you need to use a proxy to be able to create
                your own app, you can use the --proxy, or an alias of -x. If you want to skip to git initialization,
                which is on by default, you could go ahead and use -n or no-git. And we're going to learn about presets
                in a later section of this module where we can skip a bunch of prompts and basically use our saved
                customizations. That's --preset, or -p.</p>
              <p>Of course, don't forget --help, which is almost always -h in most CLIs I've ever used.</p>
              <p>You may have been wondering about earlier when we saw a -d and b together. Yes, we can combine some of
                these single character aliases. We could do:</p>
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue create hello vue -dbm yarn</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 04-009</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>right here, and what this means is we're going to use the defaults, we're going to have a bare project,
                and we're going to use the Yarn package manager, so we're combining those three together. This just
                makes it easy to use and we can set a bunch of options as we see here. Now that we've learned about some
                of these options, let's go try them ourselves. </>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Creating a Default, Bare App with Yarn</h3>
            <p>Let's open up VS Code. I'm using the Insiders version. Now I'm going to hit Cmd+Shift+P, or it could be
              Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows, then we're going to open up the integrated terminal, just like that. Now notice
              that I'm inside of the folder called play/vue:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-010.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-010</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>You should be inside whatever folder that you're creating these projects in. First we're going to type in
            </p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue --help</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 04-011</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>That's going to give us the help commands for the Vue CLI itself. We see that create is in there:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-012.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-012</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>so we're going to do vue create --help. Now we can see the different commands that we can use on vue
              create:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-013.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-013</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We've used vue default before right here, but let's try out the bare with default. So now we'll do:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue create hello-vue-bare -dbm -yarn</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 04-014</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We'll do d for default, b for bare, and let's also throw in the m for package manager and we'll specify
              yarn. Now when I hit Enter, it's going to create this project. And notice it's using yarn, right here:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-015.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-015.PNG</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>so yarn install, and it's going to go get all of the packages that we need and put it on our machines.
              Perfect. Now we have hello vue bare, and it's giving us the commands to get in there. We'll do:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">cd hello-vue-bare</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 04-016</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>like that. Now we can type:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">yarn serve</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 04-017</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>but here's a quick VS Code tip. When you're inside the integrated terminal, notice that my folder on the
              left in the Explorer is the Vue folder:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-018.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-018</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And now inside of terminal, I'm one level down. If I want to make the Explorer show just hello-vue-bare,
              I could close VS Code and restart it, but check out this tip. If you're using Code, just type:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">code . -r</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 04-019</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>if you're using Code Insiders, you type:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">code-insiders . -r</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 04-020</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Say you want to open up which folder, the current one I'm in. I want to get to hello-vue-bare, and then
              I'm going to do -r. Basically it's going to replace this running instance of VS Code with one that'll have
              the folders in the left showing that folder I want. Now I hit Enter, you'll see a flash of the screen, and
              now you can see that the folder I'm in is the vue bare project:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-021.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-021</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>If we open up package. json, we can see the name right there on line 2:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-022.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-022</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I'm going to open up the terminal again, Cmd+Shift+P, view integrated terminal, and we're back in
              business. So what did the vue bare project give us? If we scroll down a little bit and we come over to
              src, we'll see that we have a single App.vue:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-023.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-023</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>which really just has the Vue logo and then an h1. If we went back and looked at the project when we
              didn't run it with bare, we would see we have all these links and helpful tips to go into the
              documentation. You'll also notice we do have yarn.lock files in here:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-024.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-024</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>because we specified Yarn as our package manager. And of course we've got the defaults because we used
              -d. So these are just some other common options that you can use when creating quick projects with Vue.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Differences in the Vue CLI Creation Prompts</h3>
            <p> Defaults are great, but most often you're going to want to set up your own customizations or use some of
              the different prompts that the CLI offers you to create your own projects. This is why it's really
              important to master the CLI prompts. I like to think about the prompts in three different ways.</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-025.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-025</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>First, we have the absence of prompts where we just use -d for our defaults. Second, we could also walk
              through the prompts one by one and choose everything each time we create a project. And then third, we can
              create a preset so we can skip the prompts and just go to our favorites.</p>
            <p>We've already tried creating defaults, and before we can create presets, it's really important to
              understand what the different prompts offer you. So let's go ahead and walk through a demo of all the
              different prompts so we can understand what they do. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Exploring the Application Creation Prompts</h3>
            <p> Let's go back to VS Code in the integrated terminal, or you can choose your own separate terminal, and
              I'm going to go back to my play/vue folder. I'm going to open back into the vue folder itself:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-026.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-026</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We'll type in:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue create prompts</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 04-027</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We're going to walk through the different prompts here:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-028.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-028</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The first prompt is a preset that I already created. You're probably not seeing that one. We'll talk more
              about prompts shortly. The second one is choosing the defaults:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-029.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-029</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and that we've already done with the -d flag. Same thing here. And then the third option is to manually
              select our features:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-030.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-030</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We're going to select this one. Notice how I'm going up and down here too. I'm using the up and down
              arrows to do this, and then I'll hit the Enter key to select it. Now we get a bunch of options that we can
              choose. Two of them are on by default currently, Babel and the Linter/Formatter:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-031.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-031</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Notice the hints on how we can select them. We can do space to select, A to toggle them all, or I to
              invert a selection. So we can do I here:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-032.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-032</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and you'll notice they're inverting all of the selections. We can do A to select them all:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-033.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-033</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>A again to deselect them:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-034.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-034</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>or we can walk through one by one. Let's choose everything, because we're just going to walk through what
              these different things mean. First, we chose that we wanted to use TypeScript, and we're now getting asked
              a question about do we want to use class-style component syntax, yes or no:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-035.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-035</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Notice that Yes is uppercase and no is in lowercase</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-036.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-036</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>That means that Yes is the default. If we just hit Enter, it will be Yes. Class-style component syntax
              means that we're going to have a class for our components, and it's going to use this at component
              decorator for TypeScript. We'll choose Yes for now.</p>
            <p>Should we use Babel alongside TypeScript for auto-detecting polyfills:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-037.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-037</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This is a good idea to make sure if we have to support older browsers, so we'll select Yes. Next, it's
              asking about the router:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-038.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-038</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Because we selected the router, we're being asked about the history mode. Generally, a good idea these
              days is to use history mode, so capital Yes here. What does this mean? This means that if we don't select
              this, we're going to have to use hash routing, and hash routing will allow us to use client-side routing
              on any server, but that's going to put the little hash in all of our URLs. We don't want that. We want
              normal URLs without the hashes, so we're going to use history mode.</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-039.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-039</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Then we can choose our CSS preprocessor. This could be Sass, Less, or Stylus. We'll choose Sass.</p>
            <p>Next, we get to choose our linter or formatter, or a combination thereof:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-040.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-040</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Because we're using TypeScript, we could choose TSLint. My favorite when I'm not using TypeScript is just
              ESLint with Prettier. You could choose whichever you like.</p>
            <p>Next, it's asking about how to fix things when we're linting:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-041.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-041</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I like to lint on save. That way when I save my files, it'll automatically check them. I happen to use
              auto save in VS Code, which I can show you up here. In the menu, you go to File, Auto Save is
              automatically checked for me:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-042.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-042</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>it may not be for you. That means any time I make a change in a file, it's going to save the code and
              it'll automatically lint it. If auto save is not on for your editor, it'll only lint when you press Save.
              If you don't want it to be that frequent, you could do lint and fix on commits.</p>
            <p>Next, we pick our unit testing solution:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-043.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-043</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>That could be Mocha and Chai or Jest. You pick your choice. And then we can choose our end-to-end testing
              framework:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-044.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-044</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Cypress or Nightwatch currently. I like Cypress, so that's the one I'm going to choose. Here's one that a
              lot of people have a strong opinion on, and I'm one of those people:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-045.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-045</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I like to have all of my configs for all these different things in dedicated config files as opposed to
              putting them all in a single file inside package.json. If we choose the dedicated config files, we'll have
              a separate file for ESLint and for Babel and for everything that we used for configuration. It's more
              files in the root, but it's much more conventional too.</p>
            <p>And then finally when you're done making your selections, it'll ask if you want to create a preset:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-046.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-046.PNG</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>No is a default here. We're not going to do it for this one, but you can absolutely choose a preset and
              then save it and then reload that later. We'll be seeing that in an upcoming section here in this module.
            </p>
            <p> Now to get out of the CLI, because we just wanted to walk through these, I'm going to hit Ctrl+C and
              it's going to cancel it. Sometimes you have to Ctrl+C twice. Here we've seen all the different prompts
              that we can use. Now notice if I go back and do a project called <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue create prompts</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 04-047</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>and this time I do manually select and I only select let's say Babel and the linter:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-047.PNG" />
                <figcaption>Fig 04-047</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>now we're skipping all the other questions that don't apply. There's no more TypeScript questions, for
                example, or unit testing questions. And again, you can just cancel out of here, and that's all you need
                to know about going to the prompts. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Understanding the Vue CLI Presets</h3>
            <p> In this section, let's learn about how we can create and share and load Vue CLI presets, because
              effectively if we're creating the same projects all the time with the same kinds of settings, we should be
              able to do that without answering all these prompts all the time.</p>
            <p>So the presets are really a lifesaver. They help us save those preferences, your preferences, for
              creating new Vue projects. Let's see how we do this. To create a preset, first we go through the prompts.
              We might use prompts like this:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-048.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-048</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>where we pick a preset and we say nope, we're going to do manual features, you might choose Babel on the
              linter, we choose all the options that we want, and when we're done, it's going to ask us if we want to
              save this as a preset. So at that point, we can save the preset by putting a y in here for yes:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-049.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-049</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and then we'll name that preset. Now by default when you save a preset, it stores it in your. vuerc file:
            </p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-050.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-050</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This dot file is in your home folder on your computer. Now that doesn't really help you for sharing it
              though, so you can go find those settings there. Another option is you can create your own preset.json
              file and just point the CLI to it. And then a great option for sharing is put it up in a repository like
              GitHub or Bitbucket so you can save it to preset.json in a repository and use that.</p>
            <p>Great. So once we have the presets, how do we use them? Well, for inner.vuerc, we'll automatically get
              prompted for them. That's how we saw the all JavaScript one earlier that I created, but what if it's up in
              GitHub or in a local file? Well, we can point to those too. We'd say:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue create hello --preset johnpapa/vue-cli-preset-all-javascript</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 04-051</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and in this case I'm assuming GitHub. I'm saying johnpapa/, and then the name of our repository. So that
              repository is up in GitHub and it's going to go look in there for a file called preset.json.</p>
            <p>You can also look at your local file. So we could do:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue create hello --preset ~/yourpath</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 04-052</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>where yourpath is whatever path your preset.json file happens to be located in. We can customize presets
              to include any options that are available in the CLI, and we can extend them with plugins that support
              things like prompts. Let's walk through how we can save, share, and load from different presets.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Creating a Preset</h3>
            <p>Let's walk through creating our own preset. We'll type in:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue create all</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 04-053</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and we'll just call this one all because that's what we're going to select in this preset. We're going to
              walk through some prompts here. We'll choose Manually select all features, and then we're going to choose
              everything. We can hit A here to select them all, and we're going to un-select TypeScript:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-054.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-054</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We're just going to do everything that happens to be JavaScript just for now just to show how we can do
              this. So we're going to walk through our different selections here. I'm going to choose Enter, Enter,
              Enter, Enter, Enter, Enter, Enter:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-055.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-055</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Just go through all of these options here and we're just going to try this out. Then we can choose to
              select a preset. I'm going to say Yes in this case, and then give it a name like all JavaScript. Now I
              already made one of my own, which you probably saw as I typed it right up here:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-056.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-056</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>at the beginning, preset for all options JavaScript. So once you save yours, you'll see it in your list
              when you run the command again, so go ahead and try that. But where does that get saved? Well it's being
              stored in a. vuerc file, so here's another trick. To load this file inside the editor, I'm going to type
              code-insiders, or you can use code if that's what you're using as your editor, and I'm going to open up
              that file:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">code ~/.vuerc -r</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 04-057</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Mine happens to be in my home folder on my Mac. Like this, it'll be in your home folder on Windows if
              you're using that as well. And then to make sure it loads inside of this instance of VS Code, I'm going to
              use -r. It's going to load:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-058.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-058</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now you'll see that that's what the options look like. Notice the name I gave it. It's up here:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-059.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-059</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Your name should appear there as well. Then I've got all of my plugins and other options that I happen to
              set in my preset. You might be wondering why it's all the same color, I'm not getting any IntelliSense
              here. If I highlight everything and I de-indent it there, if that's a word, and then I format, nothing's
              really working here. In fact, the editor tells me I don't know what kind of file this is:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-060.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-060</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p> It's a. vuerc. We can't expect the editor to know everything, right? So here's a neat thing you can try
              inside of VS Code. If you go to Cmd+Shift+P, or Ctrl+Shift+P, the Command palette, and you type in
              settings up top, we're going to go to the Preferences, User settings:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-061.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-061</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now up here we're going to type in file associations, or part of the word like this:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-062.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-062</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And then we can select Files: Associations here in the JSON settings. Now at the bottom of this file, I'm
              just going to type in file. associations, and then I'm going to tell it, look, when you see a. vuerc file
              that happens to be JSON format, like this:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-063.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-063</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and make sure you save that file if you don't have auto save on. Now when I go back to my. vuerc, notice
              I'm getting color coding:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-064.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-064</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>because it knows it's JSON, and if I format this document, which I can do through Cmd+Shift+P again or
              Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows, now I can format that:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-065.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-065</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So here we can see where we can find our. vuerc file and look at the formatting for the presets and how
              we can edit it right here inside of VS Code. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Creating an App from a Preset</h3>
            <p>If you want to create a file that you can use or give to a friend so they can use your presets, you can
              do that too. To do that, let's grab just the preset information:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-066.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-066</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We don't need all the JSON from. vuerc file. We could type this from here if we wanted to, but just to
              make this easier to see, I'll collapse the plugins. Let me grab everything that's inside of these curly
              braces right there:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-067.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-067</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I'll create a new file, and then you'll see here I've got some JSON, which basically includes all the
              settings that we want for our preset:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-068.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-068</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I'm going to save this file. We're going to call it preset.json and I'm going to put it inside my
              play/vue folder. And there we go. Then I can format the file and it should be good to go. Make sure you
              got all the JSON right. Now once I have that file and I have these different options in there, whatever
              those presets are, we can automatically use those to create a project, and of course you can edit this if
              you want to. For example, we can say you know what, we don't really want Vuex in this particular case:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-069.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-069</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So now I could say inside of my vue folder:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue create --preset ./ my-app</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 04-070</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and I point to this file. Now if you named it preset. json, all you have to do is point to the folder
              that it's in, and I'm in the same folder where preset. json is so I just can say:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">/.</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 04-071</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>If it was another folder, I could say other/folder, wherever it happens to be. And then I can name my
              app, so I'm just going to call it my-app, and then when I run through this, it's going to generate an app
              using the presets that I have right here. Perfect. Once that's done, we now have a project, which we can
              get into called my-app, and we can see all the files that happen to be in there:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-072.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-072</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This is how you can create a local file for preset. json. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Sharing and Using Remote Presets</h3>
            <p> A lot of us work on teams, large and small. When I work on teams, what I like is to have consistent
              conventions. So for my presets, I like to put them up in GitHub. You'll see one here at this GitHub
              repository at johnpapa/vue-cli-preset-all-javascript:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-073.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-073</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and you can see inside the preset.json file:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-074.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-074</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>those are the presets I use when I want to use all the JavaScript options. Then from the ReadMe, you can
              see the command that we can use to run that:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-075.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-075</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Let's copy that for a moment. And we'll flip back to VS Code. Inside of our vue folder, we'll paste that.
              Before we run it, we'll give it a different project name:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue create -- preset johnpapa/vue-cli-preset-all-javascript vue-hello-js</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 04-076</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So we're saying vue create, use the preset located at GitHub, johnpapa/, and then the URL name, and then
              we'll give it a new and unique name. You pick whatever you want. Now when we enter that, it's going to run
              through the preset up in the GitHub repository, and then it's going to run through what all those presets
              happen to need.</p>
            <p>Now while it's doing that, another option we could do, we'll flip back over to the GitHub repository, is
              notice inside the preset, I've got the eslint plugin here on line 6:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-077.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-077</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>set to use Prettier and lintOn save. What if we wanted to use this eslint plugin, but instead of defining
              we want Prettier and lintOn save, we want to ask the user with a prompt. Instead we could replace lines 7
              and 8:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-078.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-078</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>with prompts true, so we just change that JSON here and that could prompt just that one part. Now the
              plugin that you're using has to support those prompts for this to work. And you can learn more about this
              more advanced option in the docs of the Vue CLI. So if we flip back over to our project that we just
              created, we can see we successfully created vue-hello-js:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-079.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-079</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>That's what I called mine. We could then see the end of that folder, and then I'm going to open it up
              inside of Code Insiders:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">code-insiders . -r</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 04-080</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and here we can see we've got Cypress running:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-080.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-080</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>That was our end-to-end test. If we look in the package. json, which is really the source of truth here,
              we can see we've got our end-to-end tests, our unit tests on lines 9 and 10:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-081.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-081</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>we've got our router on line 15, our service worker for our PWA in 13, Vuex on line 16, and so on and so
              forth. You may have also wondered, what happens if your repository is private because maybe you didn't
              want to share the presets outside of your company. Well you can do that too. Just make sure you set up
              your repo, and if it is private, use the --clone option when you do a vue create with the preset. </p>

            <h3>App Creation Options and What's Next?</h3>
            <p> You just learned how to use the Vue CLI to create Vue applications in a variety of ways:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig04-082.PNG" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-082</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>You can use the options like default and bare, or you can set the package manager to Yarn or npm.
              Sometimes we need a little bit more customization on things so we can go through the manual process of all
              the prompts by just running vue create with no options. And we also learned how we can use the vue presets
              to create our own presets and then share them with other people. There's one other way to create Vue
              applications, and that's using the Vue CLI's UI. We'll learn more about that in a later module. Next up,
              let's learn how we can build and serve Vue applications. </p>
