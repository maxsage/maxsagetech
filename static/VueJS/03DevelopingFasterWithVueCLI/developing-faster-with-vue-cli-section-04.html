            <h3>Using Great Tooling for Vue</h3>
            <p>One of the best positive influences that we can have in our development experiences is using great
              tooling, and that applies to Vue developers as well. In this module, we're going to talk about the
              essential Vue tools that are going to help you become a great Vue developer.</p>
            <p>We'll start off by talking about the single most impactful tool that you can have in your toolbox, and of
              course that is the Vue CLI, and sometimes when you're just not sure how to solve a problem, don't worry,
              there's some great Vue documentation for various libraries up there, and we'll take a look at some of
              those so you know how to find them.</p>
            <p>We live in the browser, so it's important to know how to use the browser tooling. We'll look at some
              plugins that you can use inside the browser and how we can do debugging in the browser for our Vue
              applications.</p>
            <p>Now when it comes time to open up our editor, we'll take a look at some great tools, things like code
              snippets and a great extension called Vetur, which helps us with writing Vue applications inside of tools
              like Visual Studio Code. This entire module is very demo driven, so let's go ahead and dive into all the
              Vue tooling that you need to have in your toolbox. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Vue CLI Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Let's get familiar with a couple of the most important Vue CLI commands. Now first we're going to run:
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue --help</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 03-001</figcaption>
              </figure>
            <p>Help is super important because when we're not sure what to do, it gives us a little bit of a hint. So
              here we can do vue help and it shows us how we can see the version or we can see the commands like create
              or add a plugin or inspect the options or do a build or invoke the UI:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-001.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-001</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We can also do these subcommands like help on things like create. So for example, I could do:
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue create --help</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 03-002</figcaption>
              </figure>
            <p>and here you'll see all the different options that we have for creating a new Vue project:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-002.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-002</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>For example, we could create a project like this:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue create foo -db</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-003</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We can add a -d flag to take the default options and a second flag -b to create a bare project. We can
              put those two letters together like -db, and the order's not important. And this designates that we're
              going to have default project settings and we're going to have a scaffold of a bare project. Basically a
              project without the beginner instructions. If you recall in the project that we created for hello-cli, it
              had a hello world component and it hooked it up with a bunch of links to documentation and things. Well,
              we don't want to do that for every project, we can just go ahead and use the bare setting.</p>
            <p>So we can combine several of these letters if we want to. Let's just go back to vue help here and maybe
              we wanted to know how vue add works. So we could do:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue add --help</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-004</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>now we can see the usage of vue add. So we can type vue add and then the options that we might want to
              use:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-005.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-005</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>In this case there were very few, like where is the npm registry if we are using a different one than the
              default, and we can specify the name of a plugin. For example, maybe Vuex or the Vue router.</p>
            <p>There's a couple other commands that we're going to get familiar with, and one of those, if we're inside
              of a project, we can do
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">cat package.json</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 03-006</figcaption>
              </figure>
            <p>which'll just show us everything inside the package. At a quick glance, you can see all the npm scripts,
              serve, build, and lint:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-007.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-007</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Let's open our favorite editor code. You can type code and then dot. Then we'll open up the project
              window and click on package.json. And now we can see the scripts:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-008.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-008</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>There's serve, build, and lint. Now these are shortcuts to be able to run the serve, build, and lint
              commands that the Vue CLI exposes.</p>
            <p>Serving will compile the application in memory and then launch it so we can then view it in a browser.
              Build will build the optimized version of the build for production by default. And lint will lint our
              entire application.</p>
            <p>Let's go back to terminal for a moment, and we'll type:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue --help</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-009</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>one more time. Notice what is missing in here:</p>
            <p>Notice that there's a create for creating a project:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-010.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-010</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>but there is no generation command. So for creating new components or new files, we just create those
              with our favorite editor. Now I personally don't think that that's a gap in the CLI, it's just that pretty
              much all you're going to do is create a component or just a plain old JavaScript file and start writing
              your code. If you need some extra help with some of the syntax, there are ways to do that, and we'll learn
              about those later in this module.
            </p></div>
          <div>
            <h3>Navigating the Vue Documentation</h3>
            <p>
              The next stop on our tour of essential tools is to look at the documentation that you're going to want to
              know how to get to and how to explore. First place, of course, is the vuejs. org home page. Let's take a
              look at the Learn button at the top:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-011.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-011</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and we can see there's a Guide, an API, Style Guide, Examples, and Cookbook. The Guide is effectively the
              docs. It's the ideal place to ask questions and get them answered for how does the v-for work with loops?
              Or v-if with conditionals? And you'll notice that the table of contents is over here on the left. And then
              you've got the content here in the middle:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-012.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-012</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I recommend reading through here even if you feel that you know Vue strongly. There's a lot of great
              information. The next stop would be the API which is under the Learn menu. The API is ideal for learning
              things like how do I know the API for props? So if we scroll down to Options/Data, props, which I'll give
              you a hint here, you could actually just on the page do search with Cmd+F and you can find the word props,
              or you could use the search up top here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-013.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-013</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and it shows you all the places you can find props. In this case it just found the guide. So I like to go
              to the page itself in the API and then just search for it, or you can just scroll through the table of
              contents. Now notice here in props it's showing us the syntax. For example, in props we can have this
              object where we've got height and then a number for the type check:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-014.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-014</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Or we could have a more complicated object like this with age. But it's great for looking up the syntax
              and things inside the API.</p>
            <p>Next on our list is the Style Guide again from the Learn menu.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-015.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-015</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>It's currently in beta at the time of recording this course. This is great though because it shows you
              different categories, and if we scroll to the left we can see those. The first one's essential rules,
              strongly recommended rules, and then recommended rules and use with caution rules.</p>
            <p>And then finally we've got Examples and Cookbook. The Cookbook is ideal for showing us scenarios and
              solutions. So notice down here in the left one of my favorites is Dockerizing your Vue App:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-016.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-016</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>First it talks about how you can use a Dockerfile and create your Vue app, and notice it's launching it
              with the HTTP server. It also explains why it made these decisions, and then how you can also use
              something like NGINX or Apache if you want to use it in production. So these are the Vue docs. </p>
            <p>There's also a whole bunch of stuff in the ecosystem. For example, of course, there's the Vue CLI.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-017.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-017</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I'll hold Cmd down and open a new tab for that. There's also the Vue Router and Vuex. Just a couple
              different things are there. The Vue CLI, we can go over and look at its own docs. We can click on Get
              Started or just go right to the Guide. If we're looking at the Vue Router, we can go click on its guide as
              well:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-018.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-018</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>which brought us right to it here in this case, we learn how to use the Vue router, or Vuex for state
              management, and we can learn how this all works.</p>
            <p>Just a recap, there's the main Vue docs, there's the Vue CLI docs, the Vue Router docs, and then the Vuex
              docs:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-019.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-019</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and many, many more. The best place to go if you're getting a little confused is right to the main Vue
              docs, and then you can look for all the other docs right from its main menu.
            </p></div>
          <div>
            <h3>Getting Familiar with the Vue Developer Tooling</h3>
            <p>
              The next stop on our dev tools tour is to look at the tools for the browser that we can use to help us
              debug and analyze Vue apps. The best place we can go for this is to open up a new tab. And then open
              github. com/vuejs/vue-devtools:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-020.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-020</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This is a repository holding the dev tools by the official Vue team. We scroll down, we can see what
              those dev tools look like, and the features it offers, and notice there's three different ways we can
              install it currently:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-021.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-021</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>One's a standalone Electron app, another one's a Firefox add-on, and the third one's a Chrome extension.
              Let's click on the Chrome extension just to see how we can get there. Notice I'm in the Chrome web store
              and then I could add it if I didn't already have it with the button over here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-022.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-022</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Once you have it in your browser, you'll see a little icon like this up here. All right, so what does this
              offer for you? To find out how we can use these tools, let's open another tab and let's type in <a
              href="jpapa.me/heroes-vue">jpapa.me/heroes-vue</a></p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-023.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-023</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This'll bring you to my GitHub repository of an app called heroes-vue. It's called the Tour of Heroes,
              and you can see it running right here in production mode if you'd like to do that. This is the Tour of
              Heroes app written with Vue:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-024.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-024</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now we're going to pull this code down. So we're going to clone it by clicking on the Clone button. I'm
              going to copy this here. You can also just download the zip if you'd like to. We'll flip back over to our
              play folder. And now I'm going to type:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">git clone https://github.com/johnpapa/heroes-vue.git</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-025</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And now once we get that, we're going to go into that folder and then run:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">npm install</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-026</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Once you've cloned the repository, we're going to run:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">npm run quick</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-027</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This is an npm script that I created that not only starts up the Vue application and serves it, but also
              starts up a back end for us. This will run the application in development mode, and then we can click on
              the port to run it locally. Notice we're running locally now:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-028.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-028</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And here if I click on the button for the Vue tool, you'll see that it detected Vue on the page. So now I
              can open up the development tools and I can go over here and click on Vue:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-029.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-029</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and you'll see that there's my elements for components, and all the different ones are showing up
              here</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-030.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-030</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Now let's go down into Heroes themselves and we'll click on the HeroList. Notice in the HeroList I've got
              a CardContent, there is Aslaug the warrior queen:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-031.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-031</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and you'll see the props are down here. And when you click on the props, you'll have options like copying
              the value. Now let's select Aslaug by doing Edit:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-032.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-032</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and if I can't figure out where the element is here I'll go over to the left and get it. The way I do
              that is to click on this little icon up here.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-033.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-033</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>That'll select component in the page. And then I can select the name for Aslaug. And down here we can see
              there's the Hero in the props:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-034.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-034</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>There's also data. Now with the data you can edit it. So let's say we wanted to change the description
              from warrior queen, we could come over here and type something different:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-035.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-035</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We could type in here it's a vue hero, and then hit Cancel or Save and notice the value changes here and
              over on the left.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-036.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-036</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We can also look at the elements here, and then flip back if we want to Vue. And the top, we can see
              there's different icons. This one is for the components:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-037.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-037</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>that's what we're looking at now. The second icon is to show Vuex:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-038.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-038</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>If your application's using Vuex for state management, which this one is, you'll see the Base State.
              Let's change Aslaug to joe.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-039.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-039</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We'll scroll down, press Save, and you'll see the change was made right here.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-040.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-040</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now we can see the full state. Notice there's 6 heroes and there are 0 villains at this point:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-041.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-041</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And we can open that up and look at them. And then we've got our getters, and then there's a mutation
              that was just made. And we can click through here using time traveling. Now, why aren't there any
              villains? Because I haven't clicked on villains yet, so now when I go get the villains you'll see the
              villains appear:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-042.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-042</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So this tool is great for showing this, and then we can stop recording or we can clear the state out. The
              third option is to show the events</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-043.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-043</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The events are nice because it shows you all the events that have happened. Let's clear this out. And now
              when I click on Edit:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-044.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-044</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>we can see it was selected on the villain list and then clicked on the button footer</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-045.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-045</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I'm going to come down here and hit Cancel:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-046.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-046</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We'll get an unselect and a clicked event that were emitted:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-047.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-047</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And then finally we've got a refresh that we can do right here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-048.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-048</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The Vue developer tools are a great complement to using the Vue CLI to help you analyze the applications
              that you're creating.
            </p></div>
          <div>
            <h3>Debugging Vue in the Browser</h3>
            <p>
              One of the most essential tools for developing with any platform is a debugger, and Vue is no exception.
              So let's run the heroes-vue app again using:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">npm run quick</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-049</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And then when it's done we'll launch this in the browser. And we'll go full screen real quick, but let's
              say we wanted to walk through this application here in a debugger. We'll open up the developer tools over
              here on the right-hand side, and we'll click on Sources:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-050.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-050.PNG</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now we happen to know that there is a heroes and a hero-list and a hero-details component in our
              application. So here we can see with sources all the files. Let's actually hide that navigator. And I'm
              going to right-click up here and choose Close all:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-051.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-051</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now let's say we want to walk through the process of what happens when we edit a hero; notice joe over
              here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-052.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-052</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So let's first go up and we happen to know it's in the hero-detail vue is where this happens. That's
              where the save is pressed. So here in saveHero on line 72 I'll set a breakpoint:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-053.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-053</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now this is going to emit a save event, and it's going to be caught by the heroes component. So I'll have
              to go look for the heroes component. It's right there:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-054.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-054</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>heroes. vue. And we should look up where for where is it getting mapped to for save? Right down here on
              line 85:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-055.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-055</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We know that because the template up top is listening on the heroDetail, right here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-056.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-056</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>for save to call the save function.</p>
            <p>So we've got our breakpoint set up and we can see these if we pull up the bottom piece of the developer
              tools:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-057.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-057</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We can now see our breakpoints set to hero-detail. vue and heroes vue. So let's go ahead and edit joe,
              and then we'll press Save down here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-058.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-058</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Notice we can catch that in the debugger. It shows us the editing hero:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-059.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-059</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We can see the description, the ID, and the name. We can also break into this in the console, and we can
              type in any of those values, so we could do this. editingHero, and we can see the whole object right
              there:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-060.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-060</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And then we can let it run through by clicking this button there to resume:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-061.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-061</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And notice now here back in the heroes component</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-062.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-062</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>it's listening to that save event that was emitted from the hero details, now we can walk through it line
              by line if we want, stepping over it. We can hover over this hero. id. Here's the new hero right
              there:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-063.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-063</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Now we can just press run, resume:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-064.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-064</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and we're good to go. Now we can disable our breakpoints:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-065.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-065</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and if we go and edit again, we can put in an exclamation in the name field and then Save. Nothing gets
              caught. There's nothing specific about Vue in this process. It's just walking through and debugging
              JavaScript inside of the Chrome development tools. I find it very useful to be able to use this as just
              another tool in my toolbox when using the Vue CLI to develop Vue applications.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Developing with Vue in Visual Studio Code</h3>
            <p>There are some great editors out there that you can use. My favorite happens to be Visual Studio Code.
              And you can grab that here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-066.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-066</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>from code. visualstudio. com. There's great support in VS Code for using things like Vue. First you can
              download the version you like. I happen to like to use the Insiders version. That's what I have installed
              here. The Stable you get once a month. The Insiders you happen to get updates almost daily, sometimes more
              than once a day. This means that you're getting the new features as soon as they're available. It's been
              extremely stable for me, so that's what I've been using for the last several years.</p>
            <p>It only takes a moment to download. We'll do that right now. And after you downloaded it, it brings you
              to a Getting Started page. Notice it's about 66 MB at the time of recording. And there we go, it's
              installed. At that point you can then install it on your machine by opening up the zip file. Now once we
              open code and we look at a project such as the HEROES-VUE project, you'll notice that when we click on a
              Vue file, all the text is the same color:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-067.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-067</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>It's not recognizing what a. vue file is. One of the great things about VS Code is you can extend it with
              language services, in this case a Vue language service, and there's an extension for that. If we click on
              the extensions icon on the left, and then go search for it, they call it Vetur, right there, by Pine
              Wu:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-068.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-068</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              we can then install this and then we'll reload. And now let's go back and look at that same file called
              heroes.vue. Notice we get all the syntax coloring and highlighting that we need.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-069.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-069</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>There's a whole lot more inside of Vetur that we get. Let's take a quick look at that by opening up the
              extension:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-070.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-070</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and now we'll type Vetur again. This time it finds one that we have. Let's go check out the docs:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-071.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-071</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>There's a lot of things that you get out of the box, like syntax-highlighting, you get a couple snippets,
              linting and error checking, formatting:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-072.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-072</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>For formatting it uses Prettier if you've got the prettierrc file inside of your project, which I happen
              to have inside the vue-heroes project. You get IntelliSense inside the template, style, and script tags
              for the single file component in Vue. There's a recipe right here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-073.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-073</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>for debugging inside of Visual Studio Code. And there's a whole lot more on there including a roadmap for
              future versions.</p>
            <p>Okay, so back inside of VS Code, let's go and look at a Vue file real quick. I'm going to hit Cmd+B to
              hide the sidebar and Cmd+J to hide the bottom panel. Now let's say that I had nothing in this file. I'm
              going to highlight everything and delete it:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-074.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-074</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Maybe I need to put in a brand new Vue file here. One of the snippets you get out of the box is called
              scaffold, and it gives you the template, the script, and then the style tags. But I happen to like another
              extension that's out there. Don't worry that this file's empty, we've got Git source control here. You can
              always undo. If you go to the extensions there's another one. This time I'm going to type in vue just to
              see what's out there. There's some Vue snippets right here from hollowtree, but there's also some from
              sarah. drasner.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-075.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-075</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I happen to like these ones here, so I'll install those. You can really use any that you like of course.
              Once we have those snippets installed, now I can type something called vbase:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-076.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-076</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and notice on the right-hand side it's previewing what I'm going to get. There's vbase. It's very similar
              to the other extension that we had. And let's say inside of here we wanted to do something with data. I
              could type in vdata. And we get the data attribute right there:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-077.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-077</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We can type our key in and our value. Let's say we wanted a method. I can type in vmethod, and there we
              go. If I wanted to do a computed, there's a vcomputed we can use. So some nice little snippets that we can
              use inside of our code as we're generating the files. And of course, like any good editor, there's always
              an undo with Git control. We can discard those changes, and we get our file back.</p>
            <p>There's a whole lot of other extensions that you can install. One of my favorites, again, is Prettier
              that you can use for formatting your code. And if you happen to like this theme, it's called Winter is
              Coming and it's one that I created. You can download and install these for free right from VS Code. I
              realize the editor is a very personal choice. I happen to really like this one because it makes my
              development flow much easier. So that's the one I'll be using throughout this course. And if you'd like to
              use it, these are some great tips that you can use to get going. </p>

            <h3>Debugging Vue in Visual Studio Code</h3>
            <p>
              We know that we can debug inside of Chrome, but if we install the extension for Chrome debugging in VS
              Code, we can do it right from VS Code. So here we can type in Chrome in the extensions marketplace:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-078.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-078</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Notice I've already got the debugger there. It's a little popular. It's got 15 million downloads. So it's
              quite the well-used extension. Let's take a look at how we can set this up. First, inside of the vue.
              config. js, notice I have from lines 2 through 4 configureWebpack and my devtool is set to source-map:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-079.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-079</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              And then let's hit the Debug pane over here</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-080.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-080</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and hit the gear:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-081.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-081</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and choose Chrome:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-082.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-082</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>That's going to set up a debug configuration for Chrome. Now we'll name this something that's a little
              more useful like Vue with Chrome. And the name is just what's going to show up in the box in the upper
              left:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-083.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-083</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              The URL is where you're launching from. Our app happens to launch from 9626:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-084.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-084</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Because it's the Tour of Heroes app it's heroes-vue. If you're using 8080 or 8000, make sure you adjust
              the port accordingly. Our web root is where our source code is. Ours happens to be in
              workspaceFolder/src:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-085.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-085</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              I like to set the setting called breakOnLoad:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-086.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-086</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I set that to true. And if you'd like to know what these things do, if you hover over them you get a
              little tooltip. And this is an experimental feature and it says here of course that if it's true it's
              going to attempt to set a breakpoint before the scripts are loaded. So it can hit anything at the
              beginning.</p>
            <p>And then there's a sourceMapPathOverride, which we're going to set. And when you automatically type this
              it's going to fill in a bunch of these options for us:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-087.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-087</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now it's okay to leave them all here, but the one we really need is right there:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-088.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-088</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>It's the second one, so we could just run with this one here.</p>
            <p>Now once we have these, what do we accomplish? We set up a launch configuration that allows us to set
              breakpoints and debug right here inside of VS Code. So how does it work? Okay, once we do this, and this
              is a one-time thing, you save this for your project. And again, we set the vue. config. js, and we set a
              launch.json file up, which is a VS Code feature.</p>
            <p>When we have both of those and the Chrome debugging extension installed, all we have to do now is run our
              app and set breakpoints. So let's close both these files. And let's go find our heroes.vue, and we'll come
              down into the data. And I'll set a breakpoint right there on the return of data:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-089.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-089</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and we'll do another one on askToDelete:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-090.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-090</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So when we click the button to delete, we should get a breakpoint there. Next we run our app. In this
              case we can run it from terminal. I'm going to open up the terminal right here inside of VS Code. It's
              integrated into it:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">npm run quick</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-091</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>will do it for me. That'll build it, and then launch it when it's ready. Don't worry about that localhost
              9627:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-092.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-092</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>that's the back-end server. We're proxying our API calls to that. Our app is actually running on 9626 as
              we can see here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-093.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-093</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now no debugger happened yet. That's because we haven't launched it. If we go back over here to the Debug
              window:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-094.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-094</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and now we click on the go button, this green button up here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-095.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-095</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>make sure that Vue: Chrome is selected because you could have multiple configurations. Now we run it. It
              launches the app in a browser and notice we hit our first breakpoint:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-096.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-096</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Return on the data. Now I'm going to go ahead and show this side by side, VS Code on the left, and we'll
              make it so we can see everything pretty good, and the app on the right. It says it's paused in the VS
              Code. Now we can let it run. Everything's good here unless we want to delete the second one. When I click
              Delete right here:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-097.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-097</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>it goes over here and it prompts us for it. So let's go back to full screen on VS Code. We can hover over
              hero and we can see the values:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-098.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-098</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We can look over on the left at the Local window. Now we can see the values there:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-099.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-099</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We can edit them as well. We can change this to John if we want to right there. Probably not a great
              idea, but we can do these things. And then we can step through one by one:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-100.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-100</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now it's going to show the modal. And if I flip back over to the code, you can see that the code is still
              running on this side, and I could let it rip. Just let it run. We're good. Now it's asking if I want to
              delete it:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-101.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-101</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I'll say no. This is how easy it is to debug projects that you create with the Vue CLI right from VS Code
              using the Chrome debugger extension.
            </p></div>

            <h3>Reviewing the Vue Tooling</h3>
            <p>In this module, we learned about all the tooling that we can use in conjunction with the Vue CLI. VS Code
              is an important part of that, and that included extensions like Prettier, Code Snippets, and Vetur. Of
              course, we need the Vue CLI and its UI to do the great tooling that it has for us to generate our projects
              and do our builds and our runs, and we integrated it all by doing debugging both through the Chrome
              browser and in VS Code using the Chrome debugging extension. And finally, don't forget that one of the
              best tools we have is the great documentation that Vue provides for us:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig03-102.PNG"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 03-102</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I'm a firm believer of making sure before you start a project that you have all your tools laid out and a
              good plan, and hopefully by going through this module you've got that plan for your Vue CLI, the
              documentation, the browser tooling, debugging plans for yourselves both with the browser and VS Code, and
              all the extensions that you need. And now we're set up to be successful using the Vue CLI to create great
              Vue applications. </p></div>
