            <h2>Getting Started with the Vue CLI</h2>
            <div>
              <h3>Introducing the Vue CLI</h3>
              <p>Hi, my name's John Papa. Welcome to my new course, Developing Faster with the Vue CLI. Thanks for
                joining me here at Pluralsight. In this first module, we're going to get started with the Vue CLI. We'll
                start by learning what the Vue CLI does for you, and then of course why you should use the Vue CLI, and
                then we'll go through a couple different demos or tours, the first of which is touring the zero
                configuration options, which help us get started quickly. And then we'll tour the Vue CLI itself. And
                finally, we'll take a look at the Vue CLI's UI. Yeah, you heard that right. The Vue CLI has a user
                interface, and it has some pretty impressive features, so let's dive right in. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Creating a Vue App with the Zero Configuration Option</h3>
              <p> One of the best ways to show off Vue is just to dive right in and show off Vue. So first, let's start
                off by installing one of the Vue packages here. It's called Vue CLI, that's the CLI itself, and we're
                going to do that globally, so I'm going to use the -g flag. We're also going to install a second global
                package here, and that's under the Vue scope, and it's going to be the cli-service-global, like this:
              </p>
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">npm i -g @vue/cli @vue/cli-service-global</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-001</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Now you really only need the Vue CLI to do most of what you want, but the cli-service-global is going
                to allow us to do something special, which we call the zero configuration option. Let's take a look at
                that.</p>
              <p>So notice I created a folder called play, and then vue inside of that.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-002.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-002</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Now just to make this easy, we're going to echo out a new file. Now in Vue, all of our templates go
                inside of a template tag, so let's create one in here with an h1, that's going to be our HTML, it's
                going to say Hello Vue CLI, and then we'll end our template like this.</p>
              <p>And the idea here is that we're going to echo this out and send it right to a file called App. vue:</p>
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">echo &quot;&lt;template&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Hello Vue CLI&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&quot; &gt; App.vue</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-003</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>and that should create that file for us. So now if we do ls (or dir in Windows) and we do App.vue, it's
                right there. We could also cat it (or type in Windows), and it shows the contents.</p>
              <p>Now that we have our single file, we can actually just say:</p>
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue serve -o</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-004</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>for open, and this is actually going to compile our Vue application and launch it in the browser, which
                you can see over here:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-005.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-005</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>This is the zero configuration option of the Vue CLI. And while you're not going to build a fully
                fledged application with this, what's nice about this is you can take some simple ideas and just try
                them out without having to create an entire file structure, or webpack, or a bunch of other things that
                you may not need.</p>
              <p>Let's say that we wanted to use an editor to change our files. I'll open up a separate terminal here,
                and I'll open this folder with VS Code, right here in the bottom left, and I'll make the terminal take
                up a little less room. And we can see that here we've got our App. vue file, and if I change this from
                Hello Vue CLI to Hello World, as soon as I save this file, we should notice a change over in the
                browser:</p>
              <figure> <img src="./images/Fig01-006.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-006</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p> because Vue is constantly looking at this and serving the changes for us. And it's that easy to create
                a new file and then try out your ideas with Vue. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Why You Should Use the Vue CLI</h3>
              <p>Now that we've taken the Vue CLI for a test drive, let's take a moment to step back and think about why
                you might want to use the Vue CLI in the first place. But first of all, CLI, what's that mean? It means
                command line interface. So we're going to be typing in at the terminal. It allows us to create things
                rapidly so you can have a really quick development experience, not just writing code, but seeing the
                code.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-007.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-007</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p> We can select different libraries that we want to use, and the Vue CLI will help configure them for
                us. One of the best features is creating the build. It can optimize the builds for loading speed. And
                depending upon how we like to write our code, and the different things we want to do with writing our
                code, we can choose our own adventure. Choosing things like TypeScript or JavaScript, or using Sass or
                ESLint.</p>
              <p>Now you might be wondering what makes building a new app so difficult? Well, when you're starting from
                scratch, you often have a blank slate. Where do you start? How do you organize the project structure? Do
                you have a style guide that you want to follow, and how do you do that once you find one, like looking
                at the Vue documentation? How do you create that optimized build, or any build at all, from scratch? How
                do you follow your team's conventions that you might have specific for your team? How would you set up
                end-to-end or unit testing? And what about plugins that you might want to add in, things like Vuetify
                for your UI, or Vuex for state management?</p>
              <p>This is why using a tool like the Vue CLI is so helpful. It's got all these kinds of features, and
                more, that are built into it.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-008.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-008</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>You want a PWA? It's there. You want to use Mocha or Jest? You got it. Do you want TypeScript or do you
                want JavaScript? Do you want Babel? No worries. All these different options come out of the box. You get
                to configure what you want. The bottom line is that the Vue CLI makes it easy for you to create these
                applications. And that's why I recommend using the Vue CLI for all applications that you start with Vue.

            <div>
              <h3>A Sneak Peek at the Vue CLI</h3>
              <p>Now let's take a sneak peek at the Vue CLI. The first thing we'll look at is how we can create a new
                application. We've seen how we can install the CLI using npm here:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-009.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-009</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>and then afterwards we can do a vue create, and then we name the project, in this case, hello-vue, and
                we can specify different flags and options here. The -d means use all the defaults. We'll learn more
                about that in a later module.</p>
              <p>So in a typical workflow, what you might do is vue create hello-world, the name of your project, and
                then cd into that project, and then run your project right out of the gate with npm run serve:</p>
              <figure> <img src="./images/Fig01-010.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-010.png</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>This is because the Vue CLI gives you an npm script called npm serve, which you can then run to
                basically build your application and then serve it in a browser. And that will watch the file, so if you
                make changes, it will automatically rebuild it and then show it again in the browser.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-011.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-011</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Here's some other commands that we're going to use and get familiar with with the Vue CLI. First, vue
                create. We're going to use that a lot. That's to create a new Vue app. Vue --help will show you all the
                commands that the Vue CLI offers. We can use --help with subcommands like vue create. So we could do a
                vue create --help to see what the create offers.</p>
              <p>When the Vue CLI creates our application, it adds three scripts by default to our package. json. Those
                are for linting, building, and serving. And as you might have guessed, we then can lint our build or
                server application using those scripts.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-012.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-012</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>But what if you don't want to type into the terminal using the CLI, it is a command line interface,
                after all? Well, the Vue CLI comes with a UI. That's right. So we have a visual way to create or
                configure our application. We can use the commands here in the window to do that. We can add plugins or
                just look at the plugins that are in our project. And of course, we can do things like build and lint
                and serve. The Vue CLI's UI looks something like this:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-013.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-013</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>and it's ever-evolving, but we can serve, build or lint, or even inspect the webpack configuration
                right from here. And it gives us a lot of tools like starting and stopping our server, analyzing what's
                in our bundles, and just a whole bunch of great goodness, which we can use:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-014.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-014</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Now that we have an idea for what the Vue CLI and the UI can do for us, let's dive right in and take a
                tour of these features for ourselves. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Test Drive the Vue CLI</h3>
              <p>The first thing we'll do is make sure we install the Vue CLI globally. Now we've already done that
                here, but we can check to make sure it's installed by doing:</p>
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue --version</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-015</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Here I can see I'm using 3. 2. 1. For you, it'll be whatever version you've installed recently. Next,
                let's create a new project. We'll do vue create and we'll call this hello-world:</p>
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue create hello-world</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-016</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Now when we set up this, we're going to get asked a bunch of options. We're going to choose the
                default, and I can use the down arrows to get to there, and then hit the Enter key. And then it's going
                to go out and install all the default options that you get with a Vue project.</p>
              <p>Once installed, there's a couple hints down here for us. For example, we can cd into hello-world, and
                we can run npm run serve.</p>
              <p>But instead, I'm going to open up my favorite code editor, Visual Studio Code:</p>
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">code .</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-017</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>If you issued the command from within the hello-world directory that was just created you should see we
                have a bunch of different files in there:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-018.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-018</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>The one we're going to look for is under src, and then components, and then HelloWorld.vue. So here we
                can see our hello-world app:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-019.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-019</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>and then back up here in the terminal, we'll run npm run serve:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-020.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-020</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>That'll build the application in memory, and then it tells us we can then browse to it at
                localhost:8080. So let's do that now. Here we can see the sample application:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-021.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-021</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Now notice it's running right now and showing it over here in the browser. If you wanted to change some
                of this, which one of the easiest things we can do is just remove some of the stuff that's on the page.
                For example, let's say we didn't want all this here for a guide:</p>
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;p&gt; For a guide and recipes on how to configure / customize this project,&lt;br&gt; check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cli.vuejs.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;vue-cli documentation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Installed CLI Plugins&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/tree/dev/packages/%40vue/cli-plugin-babel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;babel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/tree/dev/packages/%40vue/cli-plugin-eslint&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;eslint&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-022</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>we could delete that. And now you can see it rebuilds it and it deleted the text we removed from
                HelloWorld.vue</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-023.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-023</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>We can get rid of these essential links:</p>
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;h3&gt;Essential Links&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Core Docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.vuejs.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.vuejs.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Community Chat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vuejs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.vuejs.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-024</figcaption>
              </figure> and as we keep deleting, you're going to see it rebuilding each time:
            </div>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-025.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 01-025</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And there we go. So now we just have simply the logo and then the Welcome to Your Vue. js App. Well this
              is great because it gives us that awesome edit, and then build, and then looking at our application
              experience. So, this hot reload option is really nice. Well let's Ctrl+C out of this, and now let's look
              at some of the other commands we can run, like npm run lint. This will lint our application. In this case,
              there were no errors found:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-026.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 01-026</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>but if there were it would report what those errors are. And by default, we're using ESLint in any
              configuration we want, and of course we can customize that ourselves. When it's time to go ahead and build
              our application so we can put it on a web server somewhere, we can run npm run build:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-027.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 01-027</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And by default, it's going to do a production build. Now the keyword here is production. Production means
              that it's going to optimize the build for our production server. So you'll notice we have a couple files
              up there, and you can see the size and the gzip size, and they are located in the dist folder:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-028.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 01-028</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So, let's say we go over to the dist folder for a moment and we can look at those. There's the same files
              that were reported:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-029.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 01-029</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now we could serve those files with any server. Just to test it out, we're going to use a quick server
              called http-server, using a tool from npm called npx. So we'll say:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">npx http-server</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 01-030</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>on the current folder (dist). Now notice it's running this port on port 8080:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">http://localhost:8080/index.html</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 01-031</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and there's our page:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-032.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 01-032</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now, we did all this from the terminal, but we could also use tooling, like the Vue CLI UI. Let's take a
              look at that next. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Test Drive the Vue CLI UI</h3>
            <p>Another powerful option with the Vue CLI is to type: <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue ui</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 01-033</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>where we get a graphical user interface to interact with the Vue CLI. So here we can see it launches on
                port 8000, and it shows us the projects that we have:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-034.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-034</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>We can create new ones or import existing ones. So here we can go ahead and put in import, and we can
                see that this is in the hello-world folder</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-035.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-035</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>We can then import that folder and here is our project:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-036.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-036</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Let's make this full screen and take a look at what we get. Notice we can kill a port. We got our new
                project here and it kind of gives a quick whirlwind of what's going on. We can look to these different
                options like installed plugins:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-037.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-037</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>We have vue/cli-service, and Babel, and ESLint out of the box. We got those because we chose the
                default options. And then up top it's giving us the option to add popular ones like the vue-router and
                vuex:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-038.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-038</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p> These are additional plugins we can put into our project. Looking over our project dependencies, we
                can see all the dependencies in our project as well, and the version numbers of those, and we can
                install new ones or we can delete existing ones:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-039.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-039</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Next, we can look at the configuration. By default, we have two right here. The first one is the Vue
                CLI's configuration:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-040.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-040</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>like where is our code actually going to get built to, dist. And we can change that if we want to. And
                we can scroll through these different options to look at how we want it to work. Now we also have
                another configuration for ESLint:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-041.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-041</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Now here we can see that we're doing Lint on save, and then our configuration is the default one. We
                can change that if we want. And we can also go define the rules that we have. And again, by default,
                we're just using the default setting, so we didn't do any of those.</p>
              <p>And finally, we can look at tasks:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-042.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-042</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Here's where we can serve our application. Let's click on that right now and see what we get. We've got
                our dashboard here:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-043.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-043</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>We've also got our output, which shows us what's happening while it serves, and then we can click on
                our analyzer, which shows us what's in the served output. So here, let's click on running the task, and
                while it's happening we can click on the output to see what's going on.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-044.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-044</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Notice here it shows us the build and it says it's running on port 8080. Let's go ahead and click on
                that. It opens up our application. And then we can click on our dashboard:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-045.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-045</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Notice it shows it's been idle. Here's our dependencies and modules and assets. And then our analyzer
                can analyze our application:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-046.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-046</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>This is really powerful because we can now look at what's inside of our bundles. And then when we're
                ready, we can stop the task. We can also go back over to our tasks here, and we see we got a build task:
              </p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-047.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 01-047</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>we can build our application, we can lint from right here. If these are familiar, that's because we can
                run these same commands right from the CLI itself from the terminal. We can also inspect the webpack
                configuration if we want to. This is just a really quick glimpse at what we can do with the Vue CLI's
                UI. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Summary and Next Steps</h3>
            <p>In this module, you got a quick tour of the Vue CLI and all the main features that it has, really just to
              give you a taste of the things that you can do, but yeah, there's so much more:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig01-048.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 01-048</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>You installed the Vue CLI and verified it by checking the version. You created your first new
              application, Hello World. We're going to create a lot more applications throughout this course using the
              Vue CLI. You linted your code, you built your application for production, and you served your first app.
            </p>
            <p>Then we also took a quick look together at how we can edit our files and then use hot reloading when we
              run that npm run serve command, so all of our changes are shown in a browser right away. That makes for a
              really great development experience.</p>
            <p>And finally, we took a look at the Vue CLI's UI, so we can run the same commands that we do in the
              terminal over in the UI. And really, you might want to choose one or the other based upon what you're
              trying to accomplish, and we'll learn more about that throughout the course. And now that your quick tour
              of the Vue CLI is over, it's time to learn all of these details and so much more. </p>
