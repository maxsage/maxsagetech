            <h2>Adding Packages and Plugins to Your Vue App with the Vue CLI</h2>
            <div>
              <h3>Overview of Plugins for the Vue CLI</h3>
              <p> One of the most common things you're going to do when building a Vue application is want to extend
                your application with other dependencies, with packages, and plugins to really light up some of the
                features in your app.</p>
              <p>In this module, we'll talk about how you can do that using the Vue CLI. First, we'll start off
                understanding what Vue plugins are, and then how we can use those not only to install dependencies, but
                also to configure our applications. We'll explore how we can find these Vue plugins, then of course
                we'll walk through how you can add and use the plugins in your applications. Let's dive in. </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              <h3>Understanding Vue CLI Plugins</h3>
              <p>A great place to start with plugins and packages is to understand what they do for you. A plugin's
                going to extend your Vue application, and usually they're going to install dependencies and some of them
                will actually ask you questions, like prompts.</p>
              <p>We've already seen some of these when we did the Vue CLI's vue create option when it installed some
                plugins out of the box for us. In those cases, like with ESLint, it asked us questions about what we
                wanted with ESLint, for example, whether we want to fix on save or not, and those answers are then used
                to figure out how to hook up the application with those plugins.</p>
              <p>Okay, so I've already revealed what are plugins. The ESLint one was one of the examples we have, but
                traits of the plugins are you'll see that they begin with these names, either scoped with @vue and then
                cli-plugin- or just vue-cli-plugin-, for example, ESLint or PWA.</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-001.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 07-001.png</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>And the way you add these is with the vue add command with the Vue CLI. Some of them are integrated
                right into the CLI like ESLint or PWA, and some of them also have their own presets, or prompts, to
                configure it.</p>
              <p>There are two very notable special cases with the naming convention. The first one is vue-router and
                the other is vuex. Both of these are very popular and odds are you're going to run across using one or
                both of these. Neither one of them follows the same naming convention that we mentioned above. But in
                general, that's the naming convention you're going to look for right up top here.</p>
              <p>Okay, so when we're adding a scoped plugin with @vue, the way it works, use the vue add command, and we
                can omit the cli-plugin- portion of the name. For example, we could say vue add @vue/cli-plugin-pwa:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-002.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 07-002</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Now that would add the PWA plugin after we already have an existing app. But we could also use the
                second command shown above, which does the same exact thing. Notice we're omitting the cli-plugin-. This
                is how you'd add the PWA plugin to an existing Vue app. And this works for @vue scoped plugins.</p>
              <p>If you see plugins with the other naming convention, the vue-cli-plugin-, you can install those using
                this command:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-003.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 07-003</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>vue add, then you just use the full name, that'll add the Apollo plugin, for example, or you could just
                do vue add apollo (as in the second example above) and that would do the same thing.</p>
              <p>Now as you might have guessed, most people just use the shortcuts. What about those prompts or the
                presets that we talked about:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-004.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 07-004</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>If you did vue add @vue/eslint, which is the shortcut syntax to add the ESLint plugin to your
                application, you would be asked some questions. Those are the prompts. Now you can skip those prompts by
                passing generator options right into the command. And the way you can do that is to call the same
                command, but then pass in those options. In the second example shown above, it's looking for
                configuration with --config, and here we're choosing airbnb, and also we're choosing lintOn to be save.
              </p>
              <p>Now, other than some of the plugins we've mentioned here, where would you find a lot of plugins? Well,
                a good old Google search will work, but you can also start with the Vue docs:</p>
              <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-005.png" />
                <figcaption>Fig 07-005</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>That's what I recommend. Go there and then look through the rich ecosystem in the menu structure in the
                documentation because they point out an awesome list and a bunch of other ideas for how you can find
                really rich plugins. Now that we've learned about the plugins and how we can add them, let's go do it
                together. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Adding a Plugin Via the Vue CLI</h3>
            <p>Let's walk through creating a project to see what the experience is for getting plugins right out of the
              gate, and then also to add plugins to an existing project. To start things off, we'll use vue create, and
              we'll do vue-plugin-demo as the name of the project. And let's choose just -d for default:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-006.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-006</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Then we'll go into the folder called vue-plugin-demo and we'll open up our favorite code editor. Now
              we'll take a quick look here inside the package.json:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-007.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-007</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and we'll see some things in here about the plugins that we may not have noticed before. Notice on lines
              14, 15, and 16:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-008.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-008</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>we see some Vue CLI dependencies. The first two are plugins. By default, we get the plugin for babel and
              for eslint. These are the defaults that we selected when we chose -d.</p>
            <p>Now let's get back to the terminal for a moment, we'll do it inside of the integrated terminal now, and
              if we type:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue create foo</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 07-009</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>just to see what those questions look like, and we'll cancel out of this in a moment. If you manually
              select the features, a lot of these features that we're selecting were hooked in through the plugins. For
              example, there's our Linter:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-010.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-010.png</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>that's the ESLint plugin right there, and notice Babel has been selected up top:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-011.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-011</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Well, what if you already had a project and you forgot to select you wanted progressive web app support:
            </p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-012.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-012</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>what do you do? Well, I'm going to cancel out of this for now, and let's say we already had this project
              called vue-plugin-demo and we wanted to add those. So we'd open up our terminal, I'll pull it up a little
              bit, we'll kind of keep an eye on the scripts and we'll keep an eye on the dev dependencies, now we can
              type</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue add --help</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 07-013</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So you type vue add, and then the name of the plugin that we want, and then any options that could be
              optional at the end of it. So we'll type vue add down here, and let's say PWA:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue add @vue/pwa</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 07-014</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And the name of this would be @vue/pwa, because remember, we can do the shortcut syntax. Or
              alternatively, we could've done:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue add @vue/cli-plugin-pwa</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 07-015</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>but let's use the shortcut syntax. And now when we add that, it's running through and installing it for
              us, and if there's any questions to ask, it will ask us those through the prompts. Now note first, I
              already had committed all my changes. When you get a new project, they're already committed. When I add a
              new plugin, it's going to make some changes to files. Minimally, it's going to change the package. json.
              With the PWA, it changed a heck of a lot more. It added a bunch of files, and it tells you right here in
              the output:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-016.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-016</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p> which is great, there were no prompts, so no questions to ask, but notice now in the git diff, we can
              see all the files that were changed or modified:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-017.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-017</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>All the Us are the new files, and the Ms are the modified ones. So I click on package.json right there:
            </p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-018.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-018</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>we can see there's a new dependency for register-service-worker:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-019.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-019</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and then a dev dependency for the CLI plugin for PWA:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-020.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-020</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Then the main.js file also changed:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-021.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-021</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>because then it's importing this file called register-service-worker:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-022.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-022</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p> and that's the new file there:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-023.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-023</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>which gives us a service worker for our Vue app. I highly recommend before you run vue add on any of your
              code, you first commit all your changes to Git. So let's do that now, let's say I'm good with the PWA, so
              I'll commit those changes. Now I followed the directions here, I did Cmd+Enter to commit them. You can
              also come up here:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-024.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-024</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and then choose Commit. Well now let's say we wanted to add a different one, we wanted to come through
              here and do add apollo, which again, this is not a scoped package, so here:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-025.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-025</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>we could have typed in vue-cli-plugin-apollo. I don't know about you, but I'm much happier just typing:
            </p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue add apollo</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 07-026</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Remember I committed the changes first, so now it's going to go out and install this plugin for us. And
              once it's done installing, we'll see the Git changes show up in the Source Control pane once again. Now
              notice this one does have a prompt:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-027.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-027</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Here it's asking would you like to add any example code? You can say yes or no, no is the default. I'm
              going to choose yes.</p>
            <p>Would you like to add a server? I'm going to say no. And then it's going to finish all of its
              installation. And again, once it's completed we can look at the git diff to see what's actually been
              changed. Notice now it actually changed the code:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-028.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-028</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>it didn't just add code, but it changed the code for one of the components to load ApolloExample instead
              of HelloWorld. And if we look at main.js, it added apolloProvider in there:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-029.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-029</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and it put it into the stack to crank it up when view starts, and of course we got our package. json
              changes. If we look over at our code and our components, we still have HelloWorld:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-030.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-030</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>it just added this other component and made that the thing that was cranking up out of the box right
              there on line 4:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-031.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-031</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now let's say I change my mind, I don't really want these. There's a simple way to undo these changes:
            </p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-032.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-032</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I can discard them all right there by clicking on the button over in source control, and then choosing
              Discard All 14 files. And now we no longer have in the package.json anything to do with Apollo.</p>
            <p>So you've learned three things about plugins with our projects. We can use vue create and then select a
              bunch of plugins right out of the gate, or we can add plugins to an existing project with vue add, and
              third, and probably most importantly, we should always commit our changes before we actually run vue add
              because then we can revert them if we want to, or we can just see at least all the files that changed
              inside of our project. </p>

          <div>
            <h3>Invoking a Plugin Via the Vue CLI</h3>
            <p>There may be a time where you've got a plugin in your application, but you want to change how you
              configured it. For example, maybe you have ESLint set up in your project, but then you want to change the
              configurations that you selected.</p>
            <p>You can do this using the invoke command of the CLI:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-033.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-033</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This is ideal for when you want to change something that you've already configured with a plugin. So the
              syntax would be vue invoke, and then the plugin name. So let's say that we added eslint with either vue
              create or vue add vue/eslint to your project, later we could then run:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue invoke @vue/eslint</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 07-034</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and that will run through the generator's prompts once again so you can reconfigure it. Let's go try this
              out together.</p>
            <p>Back in our project called vue-plugin-demo, we already had eslint configured:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-035.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-035</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and also pwa and babel. So instead of typing in just vue add, instead we're going to type vue invoke, and
              then I like to do help first to see what the syntax looks like, so we'll do:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue invoke @vue/eslint</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 07-036</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And it's going to run through now and ask us the configuration for this plugin. Remember, we're not
              adding from scratch, but we're just changing the configuration. And just like with vue add, I always like
              to commit first so I can see what the changes will be. So let's say I wanted to change to use Airbnb.</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-037.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-037</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We'll select that and we'll do Lint and fix on commit just to show what it looks like. Notice right out
              of the gate, we're seeing some changes over on the left:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-038.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-038</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We can take a look at these as it's going through. So here is the editor config, which it added that as a
              new file. And then you'll also notice babel.config shows up here:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-039.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-039</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We're now getting different formatting, we've got commas at the end of our lines. Our package.json
              changed because we have ESLint config for Airbnb:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-040.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-040</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Our app vue changed slightly, why? Probably more configuration:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-041.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-041</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Again, semicolons and commas showing up in different places. So that's what a lot of these code changes
              are, it's changing the actual formatting of the code. Now once again if you don't like these settings, you
              could just discard them right like this:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-042.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-042</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And this is a really nice feature because sometimes we plan on something at the beginning of a project,
              or we add a feature in with vue add, but then we're like, you know what, we want to make a small change to
              this. And that's where vue invoke really fits in nicely. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Using the Vue CLI UI for Plugins</h3>
            <p> Sometimes you need a little help finding the different plugins or setting them up and configuring them.
              I really like the Vue UI for this, so let's take a quick look at that by just typing in:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue ui</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 07-043</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>into a terminal. First let's go and open up a project, we'll import the one we just created under vue:
            </p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-044.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-044</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p> and then we called this one vue-plugin-demo:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-045.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-045</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now if we go look at the puzzle piece over here on the left:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-046.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-046</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>that icon means plugins. So here's the plugins that we have in our project:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-047.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-047</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Let's get a little tour of how this works first. You can filter through what you have in your project
              just by typing in a word, like PWA:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-048.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-048</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>If you want to add a new plugin, you can click on these two right here:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-049.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-049</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>those are the special cases we mentioned before. So now I can click on vue-router, and then I can click
              Continue:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-050.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-050</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>it will install the router for us. Now before we continue with plugins, if we look over on the left
              you'll see Dependencies:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-051.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-051</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now you'll see the vue-router is there:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-052.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-052</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Of course, register-service-worker:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-053.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-053</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>effectively this is a much nicer look at your package.json.</p>
            <p>Going back over to the plugins, you can see our plugins here, and now notice that vue-router is gone at
              the top, we can now click on Add plugin:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-054.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-054</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p> and we can search for them. At the time of this recording these were sorted it seems by the most
              downloaded or used ones, and you can see up here that these are the @vue scoped ones:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-055.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-055</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We've already got Babel and ESLint in our project. And we can scroll through these and look to see what
              do we want to add. Maybe we wanted vuetify. Well first, we could just type in at the top too. Then we get
              a little bit of a filtered view. Once we click on that:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-056.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-056</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>we can then go to here for more info:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-057.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-057</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>It opens up the GitHub repository, or we can install it in the bottom right-hand corner:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-058.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-058</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now notice that it's asking us information:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-059.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-059</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>these are the prompts. Do we want to preset? Default recommended, or do we want to use one of these other
              options? So, any of the prompts that are there, it'll automatically show up inside these screens. And any
              file changes that got made will then show up here showing a little git diff:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-060.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-060</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>so now we can see that the changes were made to our package.json, and our index. html, and our App. vue.
              Now we can skip the Git changes:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-061.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-061</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This doesn't mean that we're not going to make the changes to the project, it just means we're not going
              to commit them right now. Maybe we want to look at our full VS Code editor to do that. So I can click on
              Skip, and it indeed did pull in vuetify:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-062.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-062</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>One last feature that's worth really looking at is the three dots in the upper hand corner:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-063.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-063</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We can update all of our plugins to the latest version by clicking this button right here. So as you can
              see, the Vue CLI is super powerful, but the Vue UI gives us another look, which might actually make it
              easier to navigate all the plugins for this ecosystem. </>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Wrap up and What's Next?</h3>
            <p>In this module, we learned how the Vue CLI can help us navigate plugins with Vue applications, and the
              plugins are the building blocks to creating really rich Vue applications:</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/Fig07-064.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 07-064</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And we can get plugins right out of the box when we create an application using vue create, or we can add
              them after the fact with vue add, and we can skip to any prompts we want if there's any prompts supported
              or presets inside of the plugin by passing those parameters in, and the plugins generator will take care
              of that for us. If we need to go back and modify an existing application's plugins, we can use vue invoke.
              And remember, we can always lean on the Vue UI to help us find those plugins and navigate it there as
              well.</p>
            <p>In the end, the Vue plugins are going to add dependencies to our application, and possibly reconfigure
              some of our code, so it's always a good idea to commit our changes to Git first. Now that we've covered
              plugins, we're going to take a closer look at the Vue UI in the next module. </p>
