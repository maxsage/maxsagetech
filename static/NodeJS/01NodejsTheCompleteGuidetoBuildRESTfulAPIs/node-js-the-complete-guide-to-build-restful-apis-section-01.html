            <p>The Complete Node Course aims to make you a highly competent Node developer.</p>
            <h3>02 What is Node</h3>
            <p>Node is a runtime environment for executing Javascript outside of a browser. Often
              Node is used to build back-end services otherwise known as API's. Client applications
              like web or mobile apps are just the surface of the app:
            </p>

              <img src="./images/Fig01-001.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 01-001</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Often they need to speak to some services on a Server or in the Cloud to send emails,
              work with data, push notifications etc.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>Node is ideal for building highly-scalable, data-intensive, real-time back end
            services.</p>
          <p>Whilst they are some similar services out there such ASP.Net, Rails, Django Node has
            the following advantages:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Easy to get started</li>
            <li>Good for prototyping and agile development</li>
            <li>Super fast and highly scalable</li>
            <li>Javascript everywhere</li>
            <li>Cleaner and more consistent codebase</li>
            <li>Largest ecosystem of open-source libs</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>03 Node Architecture</h3>
          <p>Node is a runtime environment for executing Javascript code. Prior to node Javascript
            was only used to write applications that ran on the browser. Every browser has a
            Javascript engine built-in which takes our Javascript code and converts it to machine
            code:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig01-002.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 01-002</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>For example:</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig01-003.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 01-003</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>The variety of engines can result in Javacript behaving differently between
            browsers.</p>
          <p>A browser provides a run-time environment for Javascript. In browsers we have window
            and document objects which allow us to work in the browser environment.
          </p>
          <p>In 2009 Ryan Dahl took Google's V8 engine and embedded it inside a C++ program called
            Node:</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig01-004.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 01-004</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>So similar to a browser Node is a run-time environment for Javascript code. It contains
            a Javascript engine that can execute our Javascript code. In addition if provides
            certain objects relevant to the environment in which the code is being executed. So
            instead of window and document objects we have objects like fs for working with the file
            system or os for interrogating the Operating System:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig01-005.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 01-005</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Node is NOT a programming language like C# or Java. Node is also NOT a framework like
            ASP.NET or Rails. These are frameworks for building web applications. Node is not a
            framework - it is a run-time environment for executing Javascript code
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>04 How Node Works</h3>
          <p>Node applications are highly-scalable. This is because of the non-blocking or
            asynchronous nature of Node - a single thread is used to handle multiple requests:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig01-006.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 01-006</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>In contrast blocking or synchronous architecture (ASP.Net or Rails) means that a single
            thread is allocated to handle that request. If, for example, this involves querying a
            database the thread must wait until the database request is complete. We then require a
            new thread if we want to serve another client:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig01-007.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 01-007</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>If we have a large number of concurrent clients then at some point we are going to run
            out of threads:</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig01-008.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 01-008</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>resulting in clients waiting for a thread to become available:</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig01-009.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 01-009</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>If we dont want them to wait we have to add more hardware:</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig01-010.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 01-010</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Node applications are asynchronous by default making it ideal for I/O intensive apps
            (disk or network). Node should NOT be used for CPU intensive applications such as video
            encoding or image manipulation. These applications involve a lot of CPU calculations but
            few operations that touch the file or network systems.
          </p>
          <p>Because Node applications are single threaded when performing the calculations to serve
            one client other clients have to wait:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig01-011.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 01-011</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>which is what makes it unsuitable for CPU intensive applications.</p>

          <h3>05 Installing Node</h3>
          <p>To see if we already have Node installed:</p>
          <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-command">node --version</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 01-012</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Install the latest stable version of Node (by running the installer) from <a
            href="https://nodejs.org">nodejs.org</a>.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>06 Your First Node Program</h3>
          <p>Create a new file called 06-your-first-node-program.js</p>

          <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function sayHello(name) { console.log('Hello ' + name); }

sayHello('Mosh');
</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 01-013</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Run the application by passing it to Node using the following terminal command:</p>
          <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-command">node 06-your-first-node-program.js</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 01-014</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Node will give the file we specified to v8 for execution.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>07 Course Structure</h3>
        <p>Section 2 covers the Node Module System which is one of the fundamental concepts in Node.
          You will learn how to create your own modules as well as use the modules built in to the
          core of Node such as operating system, file system http etc.
        </p>
        <p>Section 3 covers Node Package Manager</p>
        <p>Sections 4 and 5 cover Building RESTful APIs with Express. Throughout these sections we
          will use a simple Javascript array to store our data because before we look at storing
          data in MongoDb you need to clearly understand asynchronous Javascript.
        </p>
        <p>Section 6 covers Asynchronous Javascript. We will look at how synchronous code differs
          from asynchronous code. We will look at various patterns for working with asynchronous
          code such as callbacks, promises and async and await.
        </p>
        <p>Sections 7,8 and 9 cover storing data using MongoDb and Mongoose (a library to make
          working with MongoDb easier)
        </p>
        <p>Section 10 covers Authentication and Authorization including role management using JSON
          web tokens.</p>
        <p>Section 11 covers handling and logging errors which is a very important topic when
          building real world applications.
        </p>
        <p>Sections 12 and 13 cover Unit and Integration testing.</p>
        <p>Section 14 looks at Test-driven development which is a way of writing software by writing
          tests first.</p>
        <p>Section 15 Details how to deploy an application to Heroku.</p>
        <h3>08 Recap</h3>
        <p>So, in this section, you learned that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Node is a runtime environment for executing JS code.</li>
          <li>Essentially, Node is a C++ program that embeds Chrome’s v8 engine, the fastest JS
            engine in the world.
          </li>
          <li>We use Node to build fast and scalable networking applications. It’s a perfect choice
            for building RESTful services.
          </li>
          <li>Node applications are single-threaded. That means a single thread is used to serve all
            clients.
          </li>
          <li>Node applications are asynchronous or non-blocking by default. That means when the
            application involves I/O operations (eg accessing the file system or the network), the
            thread doesn’t wait (or block) for the result of the operation. It is released to serve
            other clients.
          </li>
          <li>This architecture makes Node ideal for building I/O-intensive applications.</li>
          <li>You should avoid using Node for CPU-intensive applications, such as a video encoding
            service. Because while executing these operations, other clients have to wait for the
            single thread to finish its job and be ready to serve them.
          </li>
          <li>In Node, we don’t have browser environment objects such as window or the document
            object. Instead, we have other objects that are not available in browsers, such as
            objects for working with the file system, network, operating system, etc.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <h3>09 Asking Questions</h3>
          <p>You may have questions throughout your course. Follow these steps to make the most of
            your course and become the best coder you can be.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Do your own research. You can usually find the answer to your question by googling
              the question or the error you’re experiencing.
            </li>
            <li>Try to solve the problem without “phoning a friend”. Coming to the resolution on
              your own will help you grow and become a stronger coder.
            </li>
            <li>Still stuck? Post your question on the discussion board for the course. My team is
              here to help!
