        <h2>Introduction to Code Splitting</h2>
        <p>At this point, we've walked through some of the more basic behaviors of webpack, including some basic input
          and output settings, a lot of loaders, and a touch of plugins. So now that we've got a better idea of the
          basics of webpack, it is time to move on to the much more complicated and certainly more interesting parts of
          what webpack can do for us. Chief among which is the idea of code splitting.</p>
        <p>So code splitting is one of the big successes, it's one of the big wins around webpack, and I'm really
          excited to start talking about it in this section. So in this section, we're gonna talk about exactly what
          code splitting is and then we're going to wire it up on this very tiny project we have.</p>
        <p>After we wire it up on this project, we're going to move over to a much more real life application. It's
          going to be an actual React application complete with tons of different components. We're not going to write
          the application ourselves, we're just going to kind of download the completed application, but we're going to
          go back to it and implement a ton of these advanced webpack features on top of it. So, the next stretch of
          videos is going to be really exciting, really exciting to get started right now.</p>
        <p>So, let's talk about exactly what code splitting is. I want you to imagine for a second that you're working
          on a new web application that consists of just two different screens:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig04-001.png"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-001</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>On the first screen on the left, we have a login screen where users are prompted with a login form. After
          they successfully log in, they are then redirected to a dashboard of sorts, where they see a big collection of
          charts and graphs, each of which has a ton of logic tied to it with a lot of data tied to it as well. So I
          want you to think a little bit, maybe a guess, which of these two pages do you think is going to involve a lot
          of JavaScript code? Or Which one is going to have more JavaScript code attached to it?</p>
        <p>Well, chances are the login form is probably going to only have just a touch of JavaScript:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig04-002.png"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-002</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The login form is just that, a form. So some JavaScript code might be getting used to generate a form
          element, validate the input and send it back to the server. I would estimate, I don't know, maybe 1-300 lines
          of code at most to put that together. And that 1-300 lines estimate is excluding any supporting libraries. So
          say, just the form itself with code that we would write ourselves as engineers maybe, you know, 1-300 lines of
          code.</p>
        <p>The dashboard, however, has a bunch of charts associated with it. So that can form, who knows, several
          thousand lines of code just to show the different charts. And then we have to add in the code needed to fetch
          the data. And we're talking about, probably, one hefty amount of JavaScript to show those different charts on
          the screen</p>
        <p>So, we can certainly say that the login page probably has significantly less JavaScript code required to show
          the login form than the dashboard does. So, think a little bit about what happens when we go to load up all
          that JavaScript. Like, when a user actually navigates to the login screen. What's really going on there? Well,
          when we're on the login forms screen we really only need the JavaScript code related to the form. It is not
          until the user successfully logs in, do we have to even start thinking about loading up the JavaScript code
          that is associated with showing a dashboard to the user:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig04-003.png"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-003</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>And that's how things would work in an ideal world. Right? We would wait for the user to log in and only
          after they're logged in will we start to spend time loading up all the JavaScript associated with showing the
          charts and graphs.</p>
        <p>And we would take that approach just to preserve, or kind of minimize, the amount of network resources we
          have to consume to show a login page on the screen. But everything we've looked at so far in the webpack world
          has featured putting out a single bundle.js file. We have like no idea of division of our outputted codebase
          just yet. So that is exactly what code splitting is meant to solve. With code splitting webpack allows us to
          split up our bundle.js output into separate individual files, and then programmatically decide when to load up
          different pieces of our bundle inside of our codebase. In other words, we can control exactly when we load up
          different modules to show different code inside of our project.</p>
        <p>In practice we would say, when a user goes to a login screen, only load up the minimum amount of code to show
          the login form on the screen. And then once they actually log in and go to the dashboard aha, now it's time to
          go and fetch all that additional JavaScript code that will be used to show the dashboard.</p>
        <p>So, you might be thinking, well, Stephen, isn't that going to result in like a big delay in between logging
          in and actually showing this page? Yes, of course, it is. You know, we are introducing some additional delay
          in transition between these two screens. But the general thought process behind handling delays, or loading
          screens, or anything of that sort, is that we want to minimize the amount of loading that a user sees when
          they first come to our application. When users first come to our application that's really the key moment.
          That's when you want your app to seem really quick and really snappy because it's going to set the tone for
          all the rest of the time that the user is making use of your application.</p>
        <p>Okay, so, let's take a quick break and then we're going to talk about exactly how we're going to modify our
          existing application to take advantage of code splitting. And we're going to figure out exactly how this whole
          code splitting system works. So let's take a quick break and we'll figure it out.</p>
        <h2>Code splitting in Practice</h2>
        <p>In the last section we discussed the idea of code splitting in Webpack. Webpack allows us to separate our
          codebase into separate blocks of JavaScript and then only load up certain parts of our codebase when we decide
          that we actually need it in some particular part of our application.</p>
        <p>In this section, we're gonna revise our application to work with code splitting, so let's figure out exactly
          how. So this is a mock up of exactly what our application is going to do:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig04-004.png"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-004</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>and, yes, it's gonna be pretty darn straightforward and simple. When a user first loads up our application,
          it'll show the screen on the left-hand side. The user is just gonna see a button that says "Click me," and
          when the user actually clicks it, well, then let's go ahead and show the image. Now this might sound like
          something that's really straightforward, but this is one of the easiest situations or kinda lowest level uses
          of code splitting around. So let's figure out exactly how we're gonna use code splitting here.</p>
        <p>I'm gonna suggest that we're going to have two files that will be used for this whole code splitting
          process:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig04-005.png"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-005</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          On the one hand, we'll have our index.js file. The index.js file is going to continue to be the entry point of
          our application. The index.js file is going to import the image_viewer only after the button that it's going
          to render is going to get clicked on. So index.js will be responsible for showing a button on the screen, and
          it will attach a click event handler to it. And once that button is clicked, we will only then load up the
          code that exists inside of the image_viewer. Then the image_viewer itself will be still responsible for
          showing an image on the screen. So that's the general plan here.</p>
        <p>So just to make sure everything is really clear, this is kind of the idea of what's going on inside of our
          app now, or how we're gonna change the app out to be:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig04-006.png"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-006</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>When a user first loads up our application, only the index.js file will be loaded up, and only after a user
          clicks on that button, are we then going to load up this additional image_viewer file as well which will be
          responsible for actually showing the image on the screen. So the user is gonna think that the button is
          responsible for like, actually showing the image, but we know that the button is actually responsible for
          loading up this additional file which is then going to take over the responsibility of rendering the image on
          the screen. So let's get started.</p>
        <p>I'm going to change over to my code editor and then we're gonna start off inside of the index.js file. Right
          now, we are importing both the sum module and the image_viewer itself:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig04-007.png"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-007</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So I'm going to say let's just start over from scratch inside this file. I'm gonna take everything that we
          currently have and just delete it. So we know that if we built our project right now, there would be
          absolutely no code inside the bundle because, remember, the index.js file is our entry point and even though
          we have these two other JavaScript files (sum.js and image_viewer.js), they are not imported into our
          application at any point in time. So the image_viewer and sum.js are currently not included into our
          bundle.</p>
        <p>
          Inside of this index.js, we're going to add in the button creation logic. So we're going to again use some
          very vanilla JavaScript code here to create this button and render it onto the screen:</p>
        <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">const button = document.createElement('button');
button.innerText = 'Click me';
button.onclick = () =&gt; {

};

document.body.appendChild(button);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-008</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This onclick right here is what makes sure that whenever a user clicks on the button, we will execute the
          code that is gonna be located inside this function. So, in theory, inside this function right here is where
          we're going to want to place some amount of logic that says, "Hey, go find the image_viewer module and load it
          up."</p>
        <p>Do make sure that you've got lowercase onclick here. If you come from a background of using React, you're
          probably very used to writing a capital C. When we're using vanilla HTML events, we do not use a capital C, it
          is lowercase, so onclick lowercase all the way through.</p>
        <p>Now after creating the button and assigning the innerText and onclick properties, we make sure that this
          thing actually ends up inside the DOM. So we'll just call document.body.appendChild and append the button to
          it.</p>
        <p>So this looks like a good start. Let's take a quick break and then come back and figure out how to set up
          this whole code splitting system.</p>
        <h2>On Demand Code Loading</h2>
        <p>In the last section, we created a button inside of our index.js file and assigned a click event handler to it
          and then rendered it to the DOM. Remember, our intent here is that when a user clicks on the button, we should
          load up our image_viewer module.</p>
        <p>So to import the image_viewer module only after the button has been clicked, we're going to add a call inside
          of this event handler to a function called System.import, and then we're gonna pass in a reference or a path
          reference to the file that we want to import:</p>
        <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">const button = document.createElement('button');
button.innerText = 'Click me';
button.onclick = () =&gt; {
    System.import('./image_viewer').then(module =&gt; {
        console.log(module);
    });
};

document.body.appendChild(button);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-009</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So we say in the same directory, represented by './', look for image_viewer, like so. Now notice that we have
          not imported any module into this file or any variable called System, so System is a global variable inside of
          JavaScript. System.import is a special function that is a part of the ES2015 module spec:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig04-010.png"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-010</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>When we place the System.import call, we pass in the name of the module that we want to import. The button
          will then, or simply the browser will then reach out to our server and try to find this module. So in
          practice, once a user clicks on our button, that's going to call System.import, and then the browser is gonna
          reach back out to the server and say, "Hey, I'm looking for that image_viewer module. Can you find it for me?
          Like, it's got to be somewhere." The server will hopefully find the image_viewer module and send it back to
          the client. And once it comes back to the client, we then have the opportunity to execute the image_viewer
          module and any code inside of it.</p>
        <p>Now keep in mind that the System.import call that we just added is only pulling in a single module of code,
          right? We're only grabbing the image_viewer module right now. But, if the image_viewer module itself had
          import statements of its own, those would be also pulled in as well. So even though we're only importing, to
          us, apparently like a single JavaScript module, we could in theory be pulling in like dozens of different
          modules that this image_viewer depends upon. Right now, just to be clear, our image does not depend on any
          other code, but it's entirely probable or even likely that the image_viewer could have its own import
          statements as well. And if it did, all of those additional modules would come down with the image_viewer when
          we got that additional script.</p>
        <p>So, let's go back over to our code. When we call System.import right here:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">System.import('./image_viewer')</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-011</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>it reaches out to our server, which is inherently an asynchronous call. In other words, it takes some amount
          of time for the browser to reach out to the server and try to find that additional script. So because it is
          some async code, the System.import call returns a Promise. So, to get access to that module when it's finally
          been loaded up, we're going to add on a.then statement, which is a part of JavaScript Promises, and then we'll
          pass it an arrow function to execute after the module has been loaded:</p>
        <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">System.import('./image_viewer').then(module =&gt; {
  console.log(module);
});</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-012</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Notice that we're going to receive that module as a variable called module. So right now, like who knows what
          that module is. Let's just console.log it and let's see what that thing is, you know, let's get our eyes on it
          and get a better idea of what the module variable here actually is. Now before we actually run this code, I
          want to make one more tiny change to our image_viewer component. So this is not a necessity at all, we're
          going to just edit our image_viewer a little bit just to make it a little bit easier to work with or a little
          bit easier to, like, figure out what's going on.</p>
        <p>Okay, so, this is not a required step whatsoever, it's just something that we're going to do to make it a
          little bit easier to figure out what's happening. Inside of the image_viewer file, we are going to only show
          the small image, and rather than just instantly showing an image on the screen, the instant that this file is
          executed, we are going to instead export a function that we can call to have the image appear on the screen.
          So again, this is not a required part of setting up code splitting. This is just something we're doing to make
          figuring out what's going on with code splitting a little bit more straightforward. So I'm gonna take out all
          the logic having to do with the big image:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig04-013.png"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-013</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So I'm gonna delete the lower couple of lines, I'm gonna take out the import big statement at the top, and
          I'm going to wrap the logic to place an image on the screen inside of a function that we will immediately
          export. So let's say export default. I'm gonna wrap all this logic inside of an arrow function, like so:</p>
        <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">export default () =&gt; {
  const image = document.createElement('img');
  image.src = small;

  document.body.appendChild(image);
};</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-014</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Okay, so, I know I've said it twice now, but again we did not have to do this, I just wanted to make sure that
          when this actually executed in the browser, we can see that the module comes in as, like, an exported thing
          with some amount of data on it. Let's just, let's run this inside our browser, and you'll get a better idea of
          why we just did this. So let's take a second to change over to our Terminal to rebuild the project – so we'll
          run:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-command">npm run build</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-015</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>And to make sure that this doesn't turn into too long a section, let's take a quick break and we'll come back
          and see what this looks like inside the browser.</p>
        <h2>System Import Calls</h2>
        <p>In the last section, we set up some code splitting inside of our application and then refactored the
          image_viewer to not automatically render an image to the DOM once it was loaded. Instead, the module is now
          exporting a function that we can call to render something to the DOM.</p>
        <p>So we just rebuilt our project. So let's flip over to the browser and see how this is working inside the
          browser now. So I'm gonna make sure that I open up my JavaScript inspector again – so here's my console. And I
          will go ahead and refresh the page now, and we're gonna see what happens:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig04-016.png"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-016</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So when I refresh the page, I now see that button on the screen, which is exactly what I expect. Let's go
          ahead and click it. So when we click it, doing so will trigger that system.import call to load up the
          image_viewer module and then console log whatever that module is:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig04-017.png"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-017</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So here's the console log right here. If we expand that thing and take a look at what it contains, you'll
          notice that it has a single accessible property on it called default. So default right here is that function
          that we just created and exported from the image_viewer file.</p>
        <p>So in practice, inside of our callback on that button handler, if we call module.default like so:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig04-018.png"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-018</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>that should execute our image_viewer function and place an image on the screen. Now before we do that,
          there's one other thing that I want you to see really quick to get a better idea of what's going on behind the
          scenes with all of this code splitting business.</p>
        <p>Inside of my Chrome console over here, I'm going to change over to the Network tab and I'm going to filter my
          network request to only show JavaScript files that have been loaded up. Now I'm going to refresh the browser.
          Okay, so, the instant I refresh the browser, you'll notice that at this point we have only loaded up a single
          file called bundle.js:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig04-019.png"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-019</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>which for us is totally expected. That is completely what I would expect at this point. But when we click the
          button, we get a second JavaScript file that comes back from the server:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig04-020.png"/>

        <p>So, clearly, there are now, seemingly, two different bundle.js files. Let's look back over to our code editor
          and take a look at the contents of both of them and figure out what's going on. So we're gonna go back over to
          my code editor, and inside of my build directory, I'm gonna first open up that bundle.js file:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig04-021.png"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-021</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So when I open this thing up, you're gonna see that there is a lot more code inside of this file than what
          there was before, when we had previously looked at the bundle.js. Inside of here, the first thing that I see –
          maybe it's slightly different for you, it may or may not – but you'll see that there is some stuff in here
          about a Jsonp callback for chunk loading. So when you enable code splitting inside of your application,
          Webpack is not like it is not magic that is going on here. The browser is not just kind of inherently figuring
          out, oh, they've got some System.import calls. No, not at all. When you enable code splitting, which is done
          just by adding a System.import call, Webpack is going to automatically change the code that is exported from
          your application, and in some cases, inject some additional amount of code as well.</p>
        <p>So in this case, because we are making use of code splitting in our application, Webpack has added in a bunch
          of logic to figure out how to go and fetch modules off the server, and that's what all this Jsonp stuff that
          you see is right here. Now if we scroll down again, and you'll find if we keep scrolling down, you'll see some
          stuff in here about handling script tags:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig04-022.png"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-022</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This is some amount of logic to say, hey, create a new script tag, go and try to find this additional chunk
          or this additional script off the server, and try to load it up off the server. So if we keep scrolling down
          though, we'll eventually come across – ah, here we go. So here is the list of all the modules under the – you
          know, if you recall we had zero and one and all that kind of good stuff. So inside of here, this is the
          index.js module:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig04-023.png"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-023</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So clearly, index.js module is still inside of bundle.js. Let's now take a look at the 0.bundle.js file. And
          so when we open this one up, you can scroll down just a little bit. And now inside of here, you'll find all
          the logic around creating our image:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig04-024.png"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-024</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So here is everything from the image_viewer.js file. So it's pretty much it – like the code that we write
          inside of our application is quite literally being split off into two separate bundle.js files.</p>
        <p>Now the last thing that I want to say about what Webpack is doing with our code here is that there is not a
          whole lot of magic around the System.import call itself:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig04-025.png"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-025</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>And what I mean by that is that you kind of notice that just by calling System.import, Webpack decided to do
          all this bundle.js stuff differently. So when we add in any System.import call into our code and Webpack
          processes it, Webpack is going to automatically search through our codebase for any calls to System.import. So
          in that regard, it's kind of like a very kind of stupid system in some respects. Like, Webpack is quite
          literally looking for calls to System.import, and if it sees a call to System.import, it's going to add in all
          that additional code.</p>
        <p>Okay, so I think that's quite a bit for right now on code splitting. The last thing we're going to do is make
          sure that when our module is actually loaded up, we're going to call module.default, which is gonna call our
          image_viewer function and show our image inside the browser. So let's replace the console log call with
          module.default, then we'll save it:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig04-026.png"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-026</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Let's rebuild our project:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-command">npm run build </code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-027</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We'll change over to the browser again. Let's refresh the page, and again we see that we get just bundle.js
          here:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig04-028.png"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-028</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>And now when we click the button, we're going to fetch that additional script. Once the script has been
          fetched, our index.js is going to call the function that it exports and show the image on the screen:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig04-029.png"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 04-029</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Okay, so this has been the simplest possible example of code splitting. In the later section, we're gonna
          walk through a much more realistic application that uses React and React Router, and we're gonna figure out
          how to implement code splitting in a much more realistic application.</p>
        <p>So, let's continue with our next Webpack topic in the next section, and eventually we'll come back to code
          splitting and talk about how we apply it in the React world. So I'll see you in the next section.</p>
