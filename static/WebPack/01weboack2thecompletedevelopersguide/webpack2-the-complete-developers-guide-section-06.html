      </div>
      <div class="panel-body">
        <h2>Introduction to Webpack Dev Server</h2>
        <p>We've been making some good progress on our test project here by splitting off a vendor bundle from our
          application-specific code. There is still some more optimizations that we can put into place in this project,
          but some of those are dependent upon React specifically. I'm going to assume that you've got maybe some
          interest in React, but I'm also going to assume maybe you don't. So we're going to cover some other very
          interesting topics around Webpack first and then we're gonna circle back to talking about some more of the
          React-specific optimization around this very particular project.</p>
        <p>So right now, a little bit aside, and we're gonna come back and talk more about optimization. This next topic
          that we're gonna discuss is one of the most important in the world of Webpack and that is how does Webpack fit
          into our overall application architecture. And we are currently running Webpack, we're spitting out some files
          here, but we are running Webpack manually every single time that we run or we make a change to our project. So
          surely, we don't really want to run Webpack manually in development and, absolutely, we don't want to even
          think about doing that in production, right? So we're gonna learn a little bit more about how Webpack works in
          a server-based world.</p>
        <p>The first thing we're gonna do is get a little bit of a better idea of what Webpack is currently doing and
          some of the different ways that we can use it in which we'll start to explore in the coming sections. So this
          is the general idea behind what we are currently doing with Webpack:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig06-001.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 06-001</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We run Webpack; we spit out some index HTML and Javascript files; we then manually open up our index.html
          file – that's the first file to be shoved into the browser – and then once that file is loaded up, the HTML
          documents says, "I've got some script tags, I should probably go and load those." And so the browser reaches
          out to our project folder and finds the vendor file and the bundle file in there as well, and so those are
          loaded up just generally in second place.</p>
        <p>So the key characteristics of our kind of workflow right now is that we are manually running Webpack, our
          files are being spit out to a single directory, and then we manually load all that stuff up into the browser.
          So, perhaps there's a little bit better way to go about this; maybe there's a little bit better way.</p>
        <p>So in this section, we're gonna start talking about another library called webpack-dev-server:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig06-002.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 06-002</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The purpose of webpack-dev-server is to act as an intermediary between our browser and our Webpack output.
          With webpack-dev-server, we only have to start our server up one time. This webpack-dev-server is then
          responsible for watching all of our project code - so like all of our project files - and automatically
          rebuilding our project whenever one of our files change. The real key aspect of webpack-dev-server is that it
          only updates the individual JavaScript modules that are changed when we save our projects – when we save any
          individual file.</p>
        <p>So rather than waiting for a 10-second rebuild time, we're going to make a change to a file, we'll save the
          file, and expect the entire project to be ready to go in a fraction of a second because Webpack will only
          update that one individual file in the vendor or bundle output.</p>
        <p>The next key difference about webpack-dev-server is that when we open up our web browser, we will no longer
          be manually loading up our index HTML document. Instead, we are going to make connection or get access to this
          webpack-dev-server, which will automatically feed us the index HTML and otherwise all the other development
          assets. So we will no longer be manually opening up index HTML, we will rely upon this development server to
          serve it back to us. And there's some definite advantages to putting that kind of the burden of that on
          webpack-dev-server that we'll figure out in just a little bit.</p>
        <p>Now on this topic, there's one other very important that I want to discuss, one other topic that I want to
          discuss. It's very important as well. We've looked at two different setups of Webpack, right? The kind of do
          it very manually ourselves and we will start to look at this little bit more advanced webpack-dev-server
          setup. There's one more topic that I want to discuss that is kind of something that's a little bit of a blind
          topic in the community, like it's something that people don't really discuss that often.</p>
        <p>What I just told you was that we are gonna use webpack-dev-server as our development server of sorts, so our
          browser will connect directly to webpack-dev-server. This server right here is something that we don't really
          have access to a lot of the guts of. So webpack-dev-server is really just about developing a client-side
          application, like single-page application with zero server-side logic. And that's the key part. We don't
          really get the opportunity to add any logic to webpack-dev-server.</p>
        <p>So what happens when we want to, say, access a database or take care of user authentication or web sockets or
          any of these other capabilities that would be traditionally handled by the server? Well that's something I
          want to make sure that we discuss a lot about as well. How do we combine together a traditional Node
          server:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig06-003.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 06-003</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          and I said Node API in here, let's just say Node server by itself, it's a little bit more clear. So how do we
          combine a traditional Node server that not only deals with Webpack, but also does other things that we would
          really expect a server to do as well? So, I want to make sure there's a little bit of a distinction between
          this type of very traditional setup that you're probably expecting to be running in, like you're probably
          expecting to build an app that has a traditional server that you can add logic to. And there's a big
          difference between running that and this webpack-dev-server. So we'll first talk about webpack-dev-server and
          then we will also come back and talk about how to integrate this entire tooling process with a very
          traditional server as well.</p>
        <p>So let's take a break, continue the next section, and start talking about how we set up
          webpack-dev-server.</p>
        <h2>Gotchas with Webpack Dev Server</h2>
        <p>In this section, we're going to install a webpack dev server. We will then run it and we'll get a little bit
          of a better idea of how it works and some of the gotchas around it, as well. The first thing we're going to
          do, is install webpack dev server as an NPM dependency.</p>
        <p>So in my terminal, we will run:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-command">npm install --save-dev webpack-dev-server@~2.2.0-rc.0</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 06-004</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So let's install that. And while this is going, we will also add a new command to our package.json file to
          instruct webpack-dev-server to start running on our project. So I'm going to change back over to my code
          editor, and open up my package.json directory. I'm going to find my script section and will add a new script
          inside of here called 'serve':</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig06-005.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 06-005</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>And when we run the serve command, we start the module web pack dev server. Do make sure that you also get
          the comma on the build line, as well. So, we've got comma, double quote serve and then webpack server.</p>
        <p>Now, you're probably looking at this and thinking, "Steven, why are we making a command for this single- like
          single command right here, right? Or just aliasing or less webpack-dev-server." Well, think back to when we
          put together the command for build, as well. The purpose behind running these single line commands or these
          single statement commands is to avoid having to install these modules globally, which can have a little bit of
          an impact when you're working on many different projects that might have different versions of these
          otherwise, very common globally installed modules.</p>
        <p>So once we have got this command added in, I'm going to save the file. Let's go back to the terminal and it
          looks like the installation was successful:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig06-006.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 06-006</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>If you see anything about unmet peer dependency or any warnings, those are totally fine.Warnings are fine, if
          you have anything that says error, an error is a problem. So if you see a warning, no problem. Error, we need
          to do some trouble shooting. So now, we can start up webpack-dev-server inside of our project directory
          with:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-command">npm run serve</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 06-009</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>When we start up webpack-dev-server, the npm run serve, you'll see a little bit of output here right of away.
          Something that says, your project is running at local host: 8080:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig06-010.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 06-010</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So this is the default port that our server is going to be running on on our local machine. Once
          webpack-dev-server is finish starting up, we'll see some very familiar output here. Whenever you run
          webpack-dev-server, it immediately tries to build our project and so we see all the output related to what
          we'd usually see when we build a project. Let's now get access to the server directly.</p>
        <p>I'm going to open up chrome, and then I will manually navigate to localhost:8080. And lo and behold, we see
          our application pop up on the screen:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig06-011.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 06-011</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Cool. Now, let's do a little bit of investigation and figure out exactly how webpack-dev-server works. It's
          clear that it probably you know, builds our application for us and now we can go to the server to load
          everything up. It still feels like everything is kind of the same as it was before though, right? Surely,
          there's something a little bit different about this. Well of course, there is something a little bit
          different. I'm going to open up my console and we'll see a little bit of warning is in here about performance
          stuff. Again, that's totally fine:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig06-012.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 06-012</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>You might see a 403 here about an image, totally fine, just a little bit of development messages being sent
          to us.</p>
        <p>Now, I want to make a change to one of our javascript files and then see what happens. Does our project
          automatically rebuild or you know, what happens in general? So I'm going to go back over to my code editor,
          I'm going to find my source directory and open up the index.js file. Then inside of here, you'll notice that I
          have already removed that console log statement, so you probably still have a console log it says 'Hi there or
          Hey there'. I'm going to add mine back in:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig06-013.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 06-013</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Like so, I'm going to save this file. Whenever we save this file, webpack-dev-server will watch for any
          changes that we make to our project files and when it sees a change, it will automatically rebuild our project
          for us. But the big key to this is that it doesn't rebuild the whole project. Let me make sure it'a a little
          bit more legible. There we go. When I make that change, webpack-dev-server will automatically rebuild our
          project, but you'll notice that it decided to only rebuild one individual file:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig06-014.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 06-014</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So the only file that got changed was the index.js file. And so, webpack-dev-server said, "Well, if that's
          the only thing that changed, I'm going to only take care of that one file". So it doesn't rebuild our entire
          project, it just takes care of that very small change. The result of which, is that the rebuild time is
          dramatically shortened, which is a very good thing. </p>
        <p>Let's make sure that it actually did rebuild. So I'm going to go back over to my browser. It looks like the
          browser has already automatically refreshed and I can see a console log of 'Hey there' inside the console:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig06-015.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 06-015</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>If you don't see its message, you can always manually refresh the page by hitting command r or refreshing it
          manually and then you should see the 'hey there' message appear on the screen.</p>
        <p>So, as we are doing development with webpack-dev-server, this is clearly the preferable way to running
          webpack over manually building the project every single time. Again, we were using npm run build constantly,
          because we were making a ton of changes to our webpack config file. If you change your webpack config file,
          you have to restart the webpack-dev-server. So webpack-dev-server will not watch for changes to the webpack
          config file. And so, since we were making so many changes to this file, we would have had to rerun our build
          process anyways and so, it didn't feel like it was quite the right time to introduce the build server just
          yet.</p>
        <p>
          Now, the very last thing that I want to talk about related to webpack-dev-server, I want you to go back over
          to your command line. I want to close out the running server by hitting control C, so you can hit it a couple
          of times that will kill the server. And I want to manually build our project again. Now, I know that we've
          done this several times but I want to do it just one more time:</p>.
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-command">npm run build</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 06-016</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We'll wait our 10 seconds or so. 10 seconds or so. Hopefully, only another second or so. It always seems to
          take just slightly longer than you'd think. Okay. There we go. Very good. So, here's our output. Now if I go
          to my project directory, you'll notice that I've got the disk folder in here:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig06-017.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 06-017</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Right? And that's exactly what we would expect, exactly what we'd expect. The disk folder is here, nothing
          has changed. Everything is behaving as we would expect. Now, I want to do something a little interesting,
          gonna do something little interesting. I'm going to go back over to my terminal and we're going to run:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-command">npm run clean</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 06-018</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>If you recall, we set up this command to automatically delete our 'dist directory'. So now, if I go back over
          to my code editor 'dist directory', 100 percent gone, totally gone. We could no longer manually run our
          application, like there's no index.html file for us to execute. Right? We're in total agreement on that.
          Surely, like there's no disk structure here, no index.html.</p>
        <p>So with that in mind, with that in mind- we're going to start our development server back up with:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-command">npm run serve</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 06-019</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Okay, let's start it back up. We will again wait those awkward 10 or 15 seconds or so. It's not that awkward
          right? I got to get some jokes that I can tell during these little pauses. It's a little like 10 second jokes,
          that will be fantastic. Something to just fill the time. But I'm dry right now. Okay. There we go. Here's our
          output. So, when we run webpack-dev-server, let's go back over to our project directory and you'll notice that
          the dist directory was not created:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig06-020.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 06-020</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Hmm, that's interesting. Well, let's go back over to Chrome. I'm going to make sure I'm on local host 8080.
          I'm going to refresh the page and our application still boots u:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig06-021.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 06-021</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So, what in the world is happening? Our application still boots up but it looks like our dist directory
          wasn't made, so our project was never built. So what is going on? Well, here's the catch; When we run
          webpack-dev-server, it internally will execute webpack but it stops webpack from actually saving any files to
          our project directory. When you run webpac-dev-server and webpack executes, nothing is saved to your hard
          drive.</p>
        <p>If you want to get a portable version of your application, and by portable I mean, like the raw development
          assets, you have to run webpack, just webpack by itself as we have been doing throughout this entire course.
          When you run webpack-dev-server and it relies upon web pack internally to build our project, those files are
          only saved in memory. So the files exist in memory as a part of the server itself.</p>
        <p>When we navigate to localhost 8080 then, the project files are served directly out of memory, not directly
          from our hard drive. So this is something that's very important to keep in mind whenever you're making use of
          webpack-dev-server. Dev server is only for development, it is not for production use.</p>
        <p>Okay. So, little bit the intricacies and gotchas behind webpack-dev-server. In general, we're going to
          continue going forward with webpack-dev-server because it gives us access to a couple of other tools that are
          really fantastic for dealing with really live development.</p>
        <p>So, let's take a quick break. We'll come back and we'll figure out some of the more advanced features around
          webpack-dev-server.</p>
