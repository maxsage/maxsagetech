        <h2>Why Do We Use Build Tools?</h2>
        <p>Hello and welcome. I'm sure you're just as excited as I am to start writing some actual code around Webpack,
          but before we start on our first project, I want to answer a couple of quick questions that you might have
          about Webpack in general. And that is, "what is Webpack?" What is it doing for us and why are we using Webpack
          at all? Why are we using Webpack now when some number of years ago we seemed to get along just fine without
          it? So why is Webpack seemingly getting so popular? Let's take a little bit of time to figure out exactly why
          Webpack is becoming so popular in the web development world, especially around the use of very rich web
          applications.</p>

        <p>To understand why Webpack is so popular, we need to understand a little bit more about the ecosystem around
          rich web applications. And note that when I say, "rich web applications", I'm talking about applications that
          have a lot of dynamic features about them. So we're not just talking about static pictures and static text,
          we're talking about really dynamic web experiences where you've got menus and buttons that create drop downs
          and, you know, a lot of content that appears on the screen - very dynamic in nature.</p>
        <p>So to understand why we are using Webpack, we're going to talk a little bit about server-side templating and
          single-page applications:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig02-001.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 02-001</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Server-side templating is a little bit more legacy technology for creating web applications and showing HTML
          documents to users. In a server-side templating world, we depend on a back-end server. And it doesn't matter
          what type of server or what language it's written in, it is just some type of server that will create an HTML
          document and send it down to a user. This HTML document is a fully rendered HTML document - and by "fully
          rendered", I mean to say it has all the information in it required that a user might want to see. So it'll
          have text and images and buttons and inputs and all those kind of good things. That's in direct stark contrast
          to a single-page application approach.</p>
        <p>In a single-page app world, our server sends down a very bare bones or a skeleton of an HTML document. Once
          the HTML document loads up, it then goes and grabs a couple of Javascript scripts, and that Javascript is then
          responsible for assembling a web page to show to the user. So again, this is - you know, we're talking about
          this stuff to give you a better idea of exactly why we are using Webpack.</p>
        <p>
          The takeaway is that in a server-side templating world, we rely upon our server to put together the HTML
          document and in a single-page app sort of world, we rely upon a big old pile of Javascript code that is being
          executed on the user's machine to put together our web document, our HTML document. So just to make sure it's
          really clear about how these two approaches work. In a server-side templating world:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig02-002.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 02-002</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>a user is going to visit our page - that forms - you know, they're going to, like, literally type in an
          address to their browser and hit enter. That's going to make an HTTP request to the server, they're going to
          get a HTML document back, then maybe at some point in time, the user clicks a link and that issues a new HTTP
          request to the server and they get back a new HTML document. So every time that you navigate around the web
          page inside of a server-side templating world, you're getting back a completely new HTML document.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig02-003.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 02-003</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In a single-page application world, however, a user is going to visit a page that makes a HTTP request to our
          server, we send back an HTML document that will also include some number of Javascript scripts. We then allow
          our front-end framework - be it react or angular, backbone, knockout.js, view.js - whatever it might be. That
          framework will boot up and it will assemble some amount of HTML on the page to display to the user. And then
          whenever a user clicks a link to, you know, presumably navigate to another page, we are not getting a brand
          new HTML document from the server; we are relying upon our front-end framework to show some amount of new
          content on the screen. So again, the big takeaway here is that we are relying upon Javascript to show some
          amount of new content on the screen.</p>
        <p>Now if we think about the popularity of these two frameworks or these two approaches over time:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig02-004.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 02-004</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>this is not an exact chart right here by any means. All I mean to say is that over time, or in the last
          couple of years, we have started to see the rise of single-page applications. They're starting to get really
          popular for whenever we have a very dynamic or very rich web experience. Now I do show like a decline of
          server-side templating here; that is not necessarily true. You know, server-side templating is still
          extraordinarily popular; it forms the vast, vast, vast majority of websites online, but as far as very dynamic
          web pages go, we're definitely seeing a trend towards single-page applications.</p>
        <p>Okay. So why is this all relevant? Why am I talking about this stuff? Well, here's the big takeaway. Here's
          the really important thing - here is why we use Webpack. In a single-page application world, we are relying
          upon Javascript code that is being executed on our user's browser to assemble the entire web application:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig02-005.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 02-005</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So in a single-page application world, we have a huge pile of Javascript that is being shipped down to our
          user's browser. A tremendous amount - tens of thousands of lines of code. Compared to the server-side
          rendering world or server-side templating world, however, there used to be very little Javascript code that we
          would send down to a client because the only Javascript code we would have would be stuff to, like, handle a
          fancy event - like whenever a user clicks on a button or something like that or a fancy animation. So in the
          server-side templating world, we didn't have very much Javascript code, but now modern web development is
          trending towards having this big, gigantic pile of Javascript that gets shuffled down to our user's browser
          every single time they make use of our web page. And that is starting to get us towards answering the question
          of why we are using Webpack.</p>
        <p>Let's take a quick break, come back and figure out exactly what Webpack does to make dealing with this
          tremendous amount of Javascript code a little bit easier.</p>
