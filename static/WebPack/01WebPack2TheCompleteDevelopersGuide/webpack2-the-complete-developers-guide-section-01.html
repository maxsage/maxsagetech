        <h2>01 Start Here!</h2>
        <p>Hello and welcome. Let's get started.We're going to start writing code very soon. But there's two quick items
          I want to discuss. The first is how do you get help in this course? By far, the best way to get a response
          from me, is to either send me a direct message over Udemy or post in the activity forums directly on the Udemy
          course web site. I'll do my best to get back to you as soon as I possibly can. I usually answer all
          correspondence one time per day, usually around 9:00 or 10:00 a.m. in the morning on PST or West Coast time.</p>
        <p>
          This course uses two Git repositories you can find on my GitHub account:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="./images/Fig01-001.PNG"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 01-001</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>If you navigate to github.com/ my
          name, which is Steven Grider, and then click on the repositories tab, you'll find two separate Git
          repositories. One is called WebPackCasts and one is called WebPackProject. WebPackCasts contains all the
          completed code for this course, so you can refer here if you ever get stuck on anything and check out the
          reference implementation.</p>
        <p>The second repository, which is called WebPackProject will be used later on
          throughout the course. So, in about a dozen or two dozen sections or so, I'll point you over to this
          WebPackProject repo. Make sure that you don't get the two sections confused. They have very similar names. If
          I ask you to clone something I'm probably going to be pointing you to this WebPackProject repository. Okay so
          that's it for administrative stuff. Let's get started with some web pack content in the next section.</p>
