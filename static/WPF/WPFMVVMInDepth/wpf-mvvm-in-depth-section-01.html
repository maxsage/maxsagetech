              Hi. This is Brian Noyes, and welcome to my course,
              WPF MVVM in Depth. I'm a software architect with over 20 years'
              experience and have been an architect, trainer, and mentor in WPF
              and XAML applications since their inception.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Model‑View‑ViewModel, or MVVM, pattern, has become the most
              common design pattern for WPF and XAML client applications. MVVM
              helps you write applications that are loosely coupled,
              maintainable, and easy to extend, evolve, and test.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this course, you'll learn everything you need to know to employ
              the MVVM pattern in your WPF apps. You'll learn about the
              fundamentals of the pattern and how to structure your application
              code, including what kind of code goes in each of your views, view
              models, models, and client services. You'll see how to set up
              communications between the views and view models using commands,
              data binding, and behaviors. You'll learn how to handle loading
              and displaying views and how to navigate or switch between
              different views using MVVM. You'll also see how to handle data
              input validation with MVVM and how to use dependency injection to
              keep all the components of your app loosely coupled and testable.
            </p>
            <p>
              So join me for this course so you can learn how to transform the
              way you approach building your WPF applications while building a
              skillset that is highly sought after in WPF and XAML application
              development.
