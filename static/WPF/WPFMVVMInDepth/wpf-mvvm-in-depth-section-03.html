          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Welcome back to the second module of WPF MVVM in Depth. In this module I want to give you a quick exposure
            or taste of how using MVVM changes some coding patterns for a simple input screen in WPF application that
            you may already be used to.
          </p>
          <p>I'll do this by stepping through three variants of the same simple application in demos.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The first will have no MVVM nor data binding in it.</li>
            <li>The second will at least leverage data binding but have no MVVM.</li>
            <li>The third will evolve into showing the same view with MVVM and a quick look at some of the communication
              between View and ViewModel that we'll get into in more detail later in the course.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Async in MVVM</h2>
          <p>
            Before we jump into the demos for this module I want to touch quickly on the concept of async. More and more
            client applications need to deal with with Async and parallelism to provide a good user experience. No
            longer is it acceptable to just put a spinning cursor in the users face and make it stop responding to input
            every time the app goes and does some fairly long lasting thing like a service call, computation or query.
          </p>
          <p>
            In .Net we now have task based async as a pattern for how to deal with these things. For MVVM this means
            that the ViewModel is often the initiator of calls that can take a long time in the big scheme of
            computation. Those calls should be made async to keep the UI responsive. As a result often the methods you
            expose on a client services layer should be async themselves because they will be calling async methods to
            get the real work done.
          </p>
          <p>
            So you will see in all my demos that the client services expose async methods based on tasks for doing the
            data access for the demo. This is done so that the same repository interface exposed to the ViewModel could
            also be used even if the data access was done via service calls. All the nuances of how async works, why you
            use it, and how you use it go way beyond what I have time to cover in this course. These are the types of
            calls that should be made async to keep the UI responsive.
          </p>

          <h2>Demo: Simple View with No MVVM or Data Binding</h2>
              <input id="Ex02-001" type="text" style="width: 100%"
                     value="C:\DevelopmentTutorials\Pluralsight-Courses\WPF MVVM In Depth\Module 2\ZzaDashboard-NoDataBinding\ZzaDashboard.sln">
          <p>
            In this first demo we're going to start with a very simple app that does not do any MVVM nor any data
            binding. First let's see it running so you can visualize what we're going to build up to:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="./images/Fig02-001.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-001</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>This terribly unsophisticated app loads up some data at the beginning, puts it into a data entry form, we
            could then go in and edit any of those fields and click on Save to Save the changes back down to the
            database.
          </p>
          <p>Now let's talk about the structure of this app. The ZzaDashboard here is the WPF application project
            itself:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="./images/Fig02-002.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-002</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Now the Zza comes from the fact that the sample data that I'll be using throughout the course is based on a
            pizza ordering domain. So there is a database with tables for Customers, Products, and Orders etc. There is
            a Data Layer (Zza.Data) which is pre-populated using Entity Framework DbContext and a set of Model objects
            including Customers, Products, and Orders etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the raw data access in Zza.Data in the Client Services layer you can see we have two
            repositories - a Customers repository and an Orders repository:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="./images/Fig02-003.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-003</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>And if you look at the methods on these repositories they return Tasks for their invocation so these are
            setup for doing the Task based Async of .Net using the async and await keywords.
          </p>
          <p>They are also Interface based in the vein of testability of MVVM. The idea is that your ViewModels should
            only depend on the interface of their dependencies and have a substitution path so that you can pass in mock
            objects that implement that same interface for unit testing purposes.
          </p>
          <p>The implementation of these repositories is basic CRUD data access through Entity Framework</p>
          <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">namespace ZzaDashboard.Services
{
    public class CustomersRepository : ICustomersRepository
    {
        ZzaDbContext _context = new ZzaDbContext();

        public Task&lt;List&lt;Customer&gt;&gt; GetCustomersAsync()
        {
            return _context.Customers.ToListAsync();
        }

        public Task&lt;Customer&gt; GetCustomerAsync(Guid id)
        {
            return _context.Customers.FirstOrDefaultAsync(c =&gt; c.Id == id);
        }

        public async Task&lt;Customer&gt; AddCustomerAsync(Customer customer)
        {
            _context.Customers.Add(customer);
            await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
            return customer;
        }</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-004</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>We have a DbContext, we're doing queries with the ToListAsync to get the Task based Async, we're doing adds
            and SaveChanges
          </p>
          <p>The key thing is that we have repositories that expose a Task based interface for the ViewModel
            consumption.
          </p>
          <p>Now in terms of the functional code for the very simple screen that you saw. We have a MainWindow that has
            an instance of a User Control in it:
          </p>
          <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">&lt;Window xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation&quot;
        xmlns:x=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml&quot;
        xmlns:Customers=&quot;clr-namespace:ZzaDashboard.Customers&quot;
        x:Class=&quot;ZzaDashboard.MainWindow&quot;
        Title=&quot;MainWindow&quot;
        Height=&quot;350&quot;
        Width=&quot;525&quot;&gt;
    &lt;Grid&gt;

        &lt;Customers:CustomerEditView CustomerId=&quot;11DA4696-CEA3-4A6D-8E83-013F1C479618&quot; HorizontalAlignment=&quot;Left&quot;
                                    Margin=&quot;42,35,0,0&quot;
                                    VerticalAlignment=&quot;Top&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;/Grid&gt;
&lt;/Window&gt;</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-005</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>For demo purposes here we're hard coding up a CustomerId that we're loading from the database. Obviously in
            a real app you'd have to have some navigation or selection mechanism to pass that as context into the View.
            We'll see how that works later with MVVM in other demos.
          </p>
          <p>The View implementation is down in this Customers folder:</p>
          <figure><img src="./images/Fig02-006.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-006</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>It's really just a simple user control with some layout using a grid:</p>
          <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">&lt;Grid x:Name=&quot;grid1&quot;
      HorizontalAlignment=&quot;Left&quot;
      Margin=&quot;10,10,0,0&quot;
      VerticalAlignment=&quot;Top&quot;&gt;
    &lt;Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;
        &lt;ColumnDefinition Width=&quot;Auto&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;ColumnDefinition Width=&quot;Auto&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;
    &lt;Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;
        &lt;RowDefinition Height=&quot;Auto&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;RowDefinition Height=&quot;Auto&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;RowDefinition Height=&quot;Auto&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;RowDefinition Height=&quot;Auto&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;
    &lt;Label Content=&quot;First Name:&quot;
           Grid.Column=&quot;0&quot;
           HorizontalAlignment=&quot;Left&quot;
           Margin=&quot;3&quot;
           Grid.Row=&quot;0&quot;
           VerticalAlignment=&quot;Center&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-007</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>And then some inputs that have Labels and TextBoxes and you can see each of the inputs has a name to it:
          </p>
          <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">&lt;Label Content=&quot;First Name:&quot;
       Grid.Column=&quot;0&quot;
       HorizontalAlignment=&quot;Left&quot;
       Margin=&quot;3&quot;
       Grid.Row=&quot;0&quot;
       VerticalAlignment=&quot;Center&quot; /&gt;
&lt;TextBox x:Name=&quot;firstNameTextBox&quot;
       Grid.Column=&quot;1&quot;
       HorizontalAlignment=&quot;Left&quot;
       Height=&quot;23&quot;
       Margin=&quot;3&quot;
       Grid.Row=&quot;0&quot;
       VerticalAlignment=&quot;Center&quot;
       Width=&quot;120&quot; /&gt;
&lt;Label Content=&quot;Last Name:&quot;
       Grid.Column=&quot;0&quot;
       HorizontalAlignment=&quot;Left&quot;
       Margin=&quot;3&quot;
       Grid.Row=&quot;1&quot;
       VerticalAlignment=&quot;Center&quot; /&gt;
&lt;TextBox x:Name=&quot;lastNameTextBox&quot;
       Grid.Column=&quot;1&quot;
       HorizontalAlignment=&quot;Left&quot;
       Height=&quot;23&quot;
       Margin=&quot;3&quot;
       Grid.Row=&quot;1&quot;
       VerticalAlignment=&quot;Center&quot;
       Width=&quot;120&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-008</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Likewise, our Save Button down at the bottom has a Click handler, so it's traditional WPF User Control
            development where you have to put all the support in the code-behind of the User Control. Here you can see
            we are newing up an instance of the repository:
          </p>
          <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">public partial class CustomerEditView : UserControl
{
    private ICustomersRepository _repository = new CustomersRepository();
    private Customer _customer = null;</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-009</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>And when the Loaded event fires we go out and get our Customer asynchronously:</p>
          <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">private async void OnLoaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    if (DesignerProperties.GetIsInDesignMode(this)) return;

    _customer = await _repository.GetCustomerAsync(CustomerId);
    if (_customer == null) return;
    firstNameTextBox.Text = _customer.FirstName;
    lastNameTextBox.Text = _customer.LastName;
    phoneTextBox.Text = _customer.Phone;
}</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-010</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Notice the async and await keywords here. Because this returns a Task you can await on that Task and the
            execution of this method will be sequential from the code's declaration perspective but this method:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-csharp">_customer = await _repository.GetCustomerAsync(CustomerId);</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-011</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>will go and potentially execute on a separate thread and then return the value back on to the UI thread
            since that's where it was called from. So it makes it so all the execution within the context of the View or
            the ViewModel stays on the UI thread.
          </p>
          <p>Now, if you don't use data binding, you can see it gets very mundane. You have to go and grab discrete
            values out of properties on your model objects and stuff them into properties on individual elements that
            you're referencing by name here in the code-behind of your view:
          </p>
          <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">private async void OnSave(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    // TODO: Validate input... call business rules... etc...
    _customer.FirstName = firstNameTextBox.Text;
    _customer.LastName = lastNameTextBox.Text;
    _customer.Phone = phoneTextBox.Text;
    await _repository.UpdateCustomerAsync(_customer);
}</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-012</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>And then when you go to save you have to pull those discrete values out, put them back on the model object
            and then you can go ahead an try to persist with that model object or call some business rules, do
            validation, whatever's appropriate. So you get this kind of grundgy push pull code that you have to do
            without data binding. In the next demo we'll quickly see how this evolves by using data binding.
          </p>
          <h2>Demo: Simple View with Data Binding</h2>
            <div>
              <input id="Ex02-002" type="text" style="width: 100%;" 
              value="C:\DevelopmentTutorials\Pluralsight-Courses\WPF MVVM In Depth\Module 2\ZzaDashboard-DataBindingNoMVVM\ZzaDashboard.sln">
          <p>
            In this next variant of the demo we have the same functionality but now we're moving in to actually using
            data binding to clean up the code some. So we have the same setup where we have the MainWindow with an
            instance of our user control here CustomerEditView inside of it:
          </p>
          <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">&lt;Customers:CustomerEditView CustomerId=&quot;11DA4696-CEA3-4A6D-8E83-013F1C479618&quot;
    HorizontalAlignment=&quot;Left&quot;
    Margin=&quot;42,35,0,0&quot;
    VerticalAlignment=&quot;Top&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-013</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>And the CustomerEditView is defined down in the Customers folder still:</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="./images/Fig02-013A.png"/>
      <figcaption>Fig 02-013A</figcaption>
    </figure>
          <p>The main difference here is that
            notice now the individual input controls are using Two-way databinding:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="./images/Fig02-013B.png"/>
<figcaption>Fig 02-013B</figcaption>
</figure>
            <p>where they bind to their DataContext
            and expose that DataContext to expose a LastName, FirstName and Phone property. The Save button is just
            using a click handler to get to an OnSave() method in the code-behind:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="./images/Fig02-013C.png"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 02-013C</figcaption>
          </figure> 
          <p>
            So now if we go and look what this does to the code-behind we can see it cleans things up considerably:
          </p>
          <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">public static readonly DependencyProperty CustomerIdProperty =
    DependencyProperty.Register(&quot;CustomerId&quot;, typeof(Guid),
    typeof(CustomerEditView), new PropertyMetadata(Guid.Empty));

private async void OnLoaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    if (DesignerProperties.GetIsInDesignMode(this)) return;

    _customer = await _repository.GetCustomerAsync(CustomerId);
    DataContext = _customer;
}

private async void OnSave(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    await _repository.UpdateCustomerAsync(_customer);
}</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-014</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            In that in the OnLoaded method we still have to go out and load our model object through our repository
            layer then we can just push that into the DataContext:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-csharp">DataContext = _customer;</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-015</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            And the individual bindings in the View then have two-way data-binding against the properties exposed on
            that Model object. Because they are Two-way that means any changes made by the user get written directly
            into that object. So, when it is time to Save we don’t have to gather any values out of the controls
            themselves (as we did in the previous example) because the data has already been transferred into that bound
            model object. So we can just go pass it to our repository layer to get it saved:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-csharp">await _repository.UpdateCustomerAsync(_customer);</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-016</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>So that cleans things up considerably. Then the next logical step is let's get all this junk out of the
            code-behind of the view and let it focus just on the structure and move the data manipulation and
            interaction logic into this separate thing we call a ViewModel.
          </p>
          <h2>Demo: Simple View Transformed to MVVM</h2>
              <input id="Ex02-003" type="text" style="width: 100%"
                     value="C:\DevelopmentTutorials\Pluralsight-Courses\WPF MVVM In Depth\Module 2\ZzaDashboard-SimpleMVVM\ZzaDashboard.sln">
          <p>Now that leads us to this version of our simple little demo. We want to take this thing and turn it into an
            MVVM application with our single View that we're using. So that means we need to break up our View into a
            View and ViewModel instead of putting code in a code-behind we put all the interaction logic and data
            manipulation into our ViewModel. Let's step through it here:

          <p>
            Firstly, in MainWindow.xaml we are still just placing statically an instance of our View (CustomerEditView)
            into the container.
          </p>
          <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">&lt;Grid&gt;
  &lt;Customers:CustomerEditView HorizontalAlignment=&quot;Left&quot; Margin=&quot;42,35,0,0&quot; VerticalAlignment=&quot;Top&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/Grid&gt;</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-017</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Notice the CustomerId property has gone from the MainWindow.xaml file because for the purposes of this demo
            we have to move it down a layer since all the data manipulation will be at the ViewModel level. Next we can
            go and look at our View and see whats changed there from the previous demo.
          </p>

        &lt;/i:EventTrigger&gt;</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-018</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            First off, if you noticed before (in CustomerEditView.xaml) there had been a Loaded event wired up here on
            the UserControl root element that has now gone. Probably first and foremost in terms of MVVM you can see
            we're newing up an instance of our CustomerEditViewModel statically here in the XAML parsing process:
          </p>
          <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">&lt;UserControl.DataContext&gt;
    &lt;local:CustomerEditViewModel CustomerId=&quot;11DA4696-CEA3-4A6D-8E83-013F1C479618&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/UserControl.DataContext&gt;</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-019</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>And the instance that's created there will then be set as the value on the DataContext of the View
            satisfying the basic equation of MVVM:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-csharp">View.DataContext = ViewModel</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 02-019A</figcaption>
        </figure>
            <p>So this is where we're statically setting our CustomerId for demo
            purposes in this case but again we'll get into ways to pass that dynamically later on.
          </p>
          <p>The individual data bindings are not much different than they were before but instead of just referencing
            for example FirstName and LastName they reference Customer.FirstName:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig02-019B.png"/>
        <figcaption>Fig 02-019B</figcaption>
      </figure>
            <p> so we are expecting that our ViewModel,
            which is the overall DataContext for this View now, is exposing a single property called Customer. That
            Customer is a reference to a Model object so we're exposing a Model object through our ViewModel allowing
            the bindings to dot down through it to it's individual properties to grab the values in a nice declarative
            fashion. So that makes it very clear when your'e reading this XAML as to exactly what this TextBox is bound
            against on the ViewModel.
          </p>
          <p>Next we drop down to our Save button and we can see the button no longer performs click handling into the
            code behind. Instead it uses a Command object. So the Command property is bound to another property exposed
            by our ViewModel called SaveCommand. We expect that to be an ICommand object (a standard interface in .Net
            for Commands) and it will be invoked whenever the button is clicked. It can also be used to enable and
            disable the button.
          </p>
          <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">&lt;Button x:Name=&quot;saveButton&quot;
    Content=&quot;Save&quot;
    Width=&quot;75&quot;
    Command=&quot;{Binding SaveCommand}&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-020</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>At the top of the CustomerEditView.xaml file we define a Behaviour:</p>
          <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp"> &lt;i:Interaction.Triggers&gt;
    &lt;i:EventTrigger EventName=&quot;Loaded&quot;&gt;
        &lt;ei:CallMethodAction TargetObject=&quot;{Binding}&quot;
                             MethodName=&quot;LoadCustomer&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/i:EventTrigger&gt;
&lt;/i:Interaction.Triggers&gt;</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-021</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>What this is is a chunk of code using the XAML behaviours library that you can add as a Nuget Package.
            I'm using one of those behaviours from the library named CallMethodAction which is able to call a method on some
            object. So we specify what object do we want to invoke something on. Well specifically what we're trying to
            do here is we still have that initialization that has to happen on Load of the View. So we want to handle
            the Loaded event in a declarative fashion here and dispatch it as a method call invocation against a method
            named LoadCustomer which is on our ViewModel which is our DataContext so a binding specified like this:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-csharp">&quot;{Binding}&quot;</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-022</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>basically gets you a reference to the whole DataContext object or ViewModel. So this little chunk of code
            in a nutshell:
          </p>
          <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp"> &lt;i:Interaction.Triggers&gt;
    &lt;i:EventTrigger EventName=&quot;Loaded&quot;&gt;
        &lt;ei:CallMethodAction TargetObject=&quot;{Binding}&quot;
                             MethodName=&quot;LoadCustomer&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/i:EventTrigger&gt;
&lt;/i:Interaction.Triggers&gt;</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-023</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Says go call the LoadCustomer method on my ViewModel when the Loaded event of the View fires. We'll see how
            to get this all wired up through Blend quickly in a later module.
          </p>
          <p>
            That leads us to our ViewModel - the focus of our MVVM world and first of it's main job is to expose data so
            the View can present it, and that would be our Customer data. So down here we see a Customer property of
            type Customer:
          </p>
          <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">public Customer Customer
{
    get { return _customer; }
    set
    {
        if (value != _customer)
        {</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-024</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            We also see that we are implementing the INotifyPropertyChanged event:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="./images/Fig02-024A.png"/>
        <figcaption>Fig 02-024A</figcaption>
      </figure>
            <p>thats because we are not going to set that
            Customer until our LoadCustomer method (this is being called from the Loaded event) gets invoked. By that
            point construction is already done, the XAML parsing is done, all the Bindings have been evaluated so we
            need to be able to signal to the View that it should refresh its data binding. That happens by firing the
            PropertyChanged event which is part of the INotifyPropertyChanged interface:
          </p>
          <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">public Customer Customer
{
    get { return _customer; }
    set
    {
        if (value != _customer)
        {
            _customer = value;
            PropertyChanged(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(&quot;Customer&quot;));
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-025</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Next we can see our SaveCommand property that we exposed publicly and bound to:</p>
          <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">public Guid CustomerId { get; set; }
public ICommand SaveCommand { get; set; }</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-026</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>That gets hooked up in the Constructor which points it to the actual handling method itself which is the
            OnSave handler:
          </p>
          <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">public CustomerEditViewModel()
{
    SaveCommand = new RelayCommand(OnSave);
}</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-027</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>From there you can see that both for the LoadCustomer() and the OnSave() method we're doing task based
            async again. So we're just wrapping our repository (our dependency) and we're invoking it with an await in
            front of it so that when it completes it's asynchronous execution we come back onto the UI thread and set
            the Customer property of our ViewModel with the result:
          </p>
          <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">public async void LoadCustomer()
{
    Customer = await _repository.GetCustomerAsync(CustomerId);
}

private async void OnSave()
{
    Customer = await _repository.UpdateCustomerAsync(Customer);
}</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-028</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            So that's a very simple MVVM in a nutshell example of a data entry form. Again through the demos in the rest
            of the course we'll get into more complicated Views, nested hierarchies of Views, navigation between Views
            and so on, and how all those come together through MVVM
          </p>
          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Data binding really lays the groundwork for MVVM. It gets the hookup of data declaratively expressed through
            XAML and makes it so there is no code in the code behind that has to directly reference the UI elements.
          </p>
          <p>It allows you to move the data management interaction logic into the ViewModel. You also saw that for
            static containment scenarios like this View-First construction (where the ViewModel is constructed in the
            XAML through the mark-up) works out fine when you have static child Views inside a container.
          </p>
          <p>Finally, you got a quick preview of several forms of communication between View and ViewModel that we'll
            dive into more details on in a later module.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the next module, we'll look at different ways of getting Views and ViewModels hooked up to each other for the
            MVVM pattern. We'll look at XAML construction, code-behind construction, ViewModel locators and using DataTemplates with
            the ViewModel first approach.  
          </p>
          <p>We'll also take a brief look at Databinding and how it facilitates the communication between View and ViewModel</p>
