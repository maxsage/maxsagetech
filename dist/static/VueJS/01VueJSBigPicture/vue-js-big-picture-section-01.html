              <p> Hello everyone. My name is Daniel Stern, and welcome to my brand-new course, Vue. js: The Big Picture.
                I'm a Pluralsight author and respected open-source developer.</p>
              <p>Now you may have heard of Vue, the amazing new tool for making web applications, but did you know that
                with over 100, 000 stars on GitHub, Vue is growing faster than React or Angular? That means learning Vue
                is a great idea for anyone whose career is in the fast and rapidly changing world of web development.
              </p>
              <p>In this course, we're going to get an overview of Vue, understanding what its features are and where
                those features are most useful. Some of the major topics we'll include are Vue's capabilities, as well
                as its limitations, using Vue to prototype applications, comparing Vue to Angular and React, of course,
                and the interesting libraries of the Vue ecosystem.</p>
              <p>Before beginning this course, you should be familiar with basic JavaScript and HTML. From here, you
                should be ready to start your journey towards being a Vue pro with great courses available at
                Pluralsight. I hope you'll join me on this exciting journey to learn Vue with Vue: The Big Picture, here
                at Pluralsight. </p>
