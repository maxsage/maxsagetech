        <div class="panel-body">
          <div>
            <h2>The Vue Ecosystem </h2>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>The Vue Ecosystem </h3>
            <p> We'll now be talking about the Vue ecosystem. The libraries we'll be talking about here are separate
              from Vue. They're a sperate npm install and they have their own maintainers; however, they're designed to
              work with Vue and let us do things that we couldn't do if we only had Vue. js.</p>
            <p>So what is the so called Vue ecosystem? Well, Vue is a small library. It's small because it only has its
              core features, the features that let you quickly render your application's Vue. In a sense, this is good,
              especially as we'll see soon when we compare the file size to React and Angular; however, there's a
              caveat. To achieve the same functionality as React or Angular, and I should point out that they also have
              their own large, distinct, unique ecosystems, you have to use other libraries together with Vue.</p>
            <p>So what are some of these libraries that you might use? Now I want to qualify this by saying that I'm
              just going to do a bird's eye view of these libraries. Rest assured many of these could have and entire
              course written on them, the length of which far exceeds this course. Hopefully in the future, I'll have a
              chance to share that course with you, but for now use this as an opportunity to gain context, to
              understand more what you'd like to learn about next.</p>
            <figure> <img src="./images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig04-001.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-001</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So one complimentary library is called Nuxt, and it's used for universal rendering. In other words, you
              use it to speed up the rendering of your application by having the server do a lot of work. It's a
              complicated process to do manually, but Nuxt tries to make it simple.</p>
            <p>Next is Vuex. Vuex is like Redux, and it's used for state management. So if you have a really big app and
              it has a lot of state, an ad-hoc solution may get unwieldy quickly.</p>
            <p>Next is Vuetify, and, yes, almost all of Vue's complimentary libraries have funny names. Vuetify is a
              component framework, so it's similar to Angular Material, and you can use it for many cool things as we'll
              see.</p>
            <p>Last one we'll talk about is Vue CLI, or the Vue Command-line Interface, which we use to scaffold and
              build your application. So first of all, Nuxt. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3> Universal Rendering with Nuxt </h3>
            <p> So you use Nuxt to create a universal application, you might also call this application server-rendered.
            </p>
            <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig04-002.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-002</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p> If you ever tried to build a universal application from scratch, you'll know there are a lot of
              challenges, not simple challenges, not trivial ones, really tricky ones that test your deepest knowledge
              of front and back-end development; however, Nuxt simplifies these challenges. So ideally, you don't even
              have to think about them. They just work.</p>
            <p>I won't get into details about all the specific features of a universal app, but I will say the end
              result is that it loads faster when you view it on your phone. Is this a big deal? Why don't you ask the
              people making billions of dollars every day because their applications load up faster on their customers'
              phones than their competitors'. Next, let's talk about Vuex. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Managing State with Vuex </h3>
            <p> So Vuex provides you a way of updating your state.</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig04-003.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-003</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The nature of your state affects the way your components are going to look, and the user's interaction
              may change that state by say introducing a new item to a list or changing their name. As the name
              suggests, it's similar to Flux or Redux. If you've used these libraries or if you've seen my excellent
              course on Pluralsight, Flux and Redux, then you'll already be 99% of the way to using Vuex because Vuex
              just basically takes these technologies and wraps them a up a little bit so it integrates nicer with Vue.
              Personally, I feel that Redux is so general that it makes a good option as well, but Vuex is, in a sense,
              more specific and more tailored to this particular job.</p>
            <p> Ultimately, the reason why you would use this is to keep applications with huge state manageable. If
              your application state consists of say just an array of numbers, then it's not necessary to have Vuex. It
              would be overkill. But if your application is a big one and has hundreds, or even thousands, of pieces of
              information in the state at any time, then Vuex will prevent this from becoming a maintenance nightmare.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Building Websites with Vuetify </h3>
            <p> Next is Veutify.</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig04-004.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-004</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So Veutify, it contains components that you put into your application, so normally you write the
              components yourself, but Veutify is a solution which comes with a basket of components for you to use. All
              these components have a visually pleasing material design aesthetic. They look smooth, and they give users
              the impression, especially on mobile, that you can just reach out and touch them.</p>
            <p>So you'd use Veutify if you were building an application from the beginning and you knew it was going to
              have a lot of standard components, buttons, lists, accordions, and to save money, you ask your team to use
              an existing solution for all these components rather than making each one yourself. As we know, building
              components is a lot of work because to build them properly, we not only have to build them, but we also
              have to make sure they're well tested, and performant, and compatible on every platform we need. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Scaffolding and Collaborating with Vue CLI </h3>
            <p> Last is Vue CLI.</p>
            <figure> <img src="./images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig04-005.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-005</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now Vue CLI is the one you might see the most because its role is kind of the most essential. You need
              something like Vue CLI at least to get your application off the ground in most cases. So it's a tool for
              creating, building, and updating your Vue applications.</p>
            <p>Using its command, you can introduce new parts to your application and change their structure in a way
              that's difficult for a new developer to get wrong. Vue CLI provides a standard way for your whole team to
              update the app. No longer does only the senior developer have the know how to add a new folder or a new
              view.</p>
            <p>In this way, junior developers can take more of the tasks they're assigned to. For example, a junior
              developer may be instructed to add a new page where the user can check their settings. Rather than needing
              a senior developer to actually set up the blank page and the routes that they use, they could use Vue CLI,
              increasing their confidence and saving the senior developer time.</p>
            <p>The end goal of using a Vue CLI is to facilitate productivity with big teams. If your team is only one or
              two people, then Vue CLI might be overkill. But the bigger it gets, the more it makes sense to use this
              tool.</p>
            <p>Let's take 2 minutes to go over a few Vue CLI commands.</p>
            <figure> <img src="./images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig04-006.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-006</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>There are commands like vue serve, vue build, vue create, and vue ui, which are in a sense twins, and vue
              add.</p>
            <p>What do they do? Well, typing vue serve into your command line will serve the application. It's the same
              as using HTTP Server or Apache.</p>
            <p>If you call build, it takes your. vue files, as well as ES6 files, and and turns them into JavaScript.
              This is the command that makes. vue files readable by browsers.</p>
            <p>Saying create or ui creates a new project. Using vue ui implements the very cool Vue User Interface,
              which is kind of this graphical tool that they've made to help you build Vue applications.</p>
            <p>So here I am in the Vue CLI UI.</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig04-007.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-007</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This is a tool that allows us to do everything we can do with the Vue CLI using a convenient interface.
              For example, we can create a new project.</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig04-008.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-008</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The UI lets us do more than just name our project. It allows us to define presets, which, for example,
              can allow us to install Babel and ESLint automatically.</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig04-009.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-009</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>It even downloads the required packages from npm.</p>
            <p>Overall, the Vue CLI UI can increase productivity and foster collaboration within your team.</p>
            <p>Lastly, vue add is a way of adding new features to Vue CLI itself. I won't get into the details, but for
              common scenarios like testing or performance there's definitely times where you'd want an extra bit of
              help.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Comparison to Existing Frameworks (Angular, React) </h3>
            <p> I feel like the vast majority of developers will find this next section interesting wherein we compare
              Vue to existing frameworks. I think this is so because a lot of us are already quite familiar with Angular
              and React. After all, they've been a big deal for many years now.</p>
            <p>So when I compare Vue to these frameworks in the next few minutes, the ideas that I present should be
              especially meaningful. And if you do not know about these frameworks, you can still learn a lot from this
              clip as in your workplace, you may be called upon to put forward your opinion on if you think you should
              use Angular, or Vue, or React for a particular part of the application. At least this way you'll have
              something intelligent and informed to say. So let's compare them. Is it the best? Is there a best
              framework?</p>
            <p>As Shakespeare said, and, yes, I do like Shakespeare a lot:</p>
            <blockquote>"There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so. "</blockquote> <cite>William
              Shakespeare, Hamlet</cite>
            <p> In other words, there definitely isn't a best framework. It's all about what your opinion is; however,
              your opinion is important because that's got a really close connection to the actual job you're trying to
              solve. This chart shows the file size of the major frameworks after they've been minified</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig04-010.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-010</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The blue bar represents Vue, while as the orange bars represent other libraries like React, AngularJS,
              and Angular. You'll note that AngularJS refers to the older version of Angular pre-2 and Angular after 2.
              So as you can see, Vue is significantly smaller than React and much smaller than Angular; however, there
              do exist solutions smaller than Vue, for example, Preact, which is a minimally featured version of React.
              It's almost not even a real library because they take so many features out. But I wanted to include it
              here because Vue isn't the smallest solution. If absolute smallness is your goal, then there's even better
              things than Vue. But Vue does a great job of reconciling the small size of Preact with the many useful
              features of say React</p>
            <p>As we know, mobile users may get bored and navigate away from your site before they've seen anything if
              the framework doesn't load in time. Thus, this is a telling chart to consult if you're trying to determine
              which framework to use to actually make the most money off your mobile commerce application.</p>
            <p>So let's compare Vue with React.</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig04-011.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-011</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So on the Vue hand, Vue builds fast and scalable apps; it speeds the render up of the application using a
              virtual DOM; it has a proprietary file type,. vue; and Vue is used to group HTML, JavaScript, and a bit of
              CSS. If you want to do more advanced stuff like conditionals or lists in your template, you'd use
              directives like v-for and v-if. When you're not sure about what structure your app should have, Vue CLI
              makes that task easy. And lastly, with Vue, if you don't use the build step, you've got an excellent
              prototyping solution on your hands. Now let's compare this to React.</p>
            <p>React also builds fast and scalable applications, and it also uses a virtual DOM to speed up the render.
              In this way, they're very similar. React has a proprietary language called JSX that's used to group HTML
              and JavaScript together. If you want to have more functionality, React doesn't have directives. It
              requires on more basic JavaScript, so you'll just use an existing JavaScript map or a ternary and replace
              for v-for and v-if. A lot of people consider these a bit trickier, so React is kind of harder in this
              sense. React has an equivalent of Vue CLI called Create React App, which also makes the structure of your
              app easy. Now unlike Vue, React really doesn't do all that much without JSX, so even if you're building a
              prototype, you should have a build step. This is a bit more work than using Vue where you can skip the
              build step if you want.</p>
            <p> Overall, they're both great frameworks. In my opinion, the executive summary is they're both awesome,
              but React is a bit harder.</p>
            <p>Now let's compare Vue to Angular. The picture on the left is Vue, and the picture on the right is
              Angular.</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig04-012.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-012</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>That's not to say that Vue is better than Angular. Angular is just more complex. There's no doubt that
              there's some people in this audience that will be much more excited about solving the maze on the right
              than solving the maze on the left because they like a challenge. Being a bit more academic with our
              comparison, first, let's talk about Vue.</p>
            <figure> <img src="./images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig04-013.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-013</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So in comparison to Angular, Vue is simple and easy to learn because it emphasizes plain HTML and
              JavaScript. Sure, you have. vue files, but those are just essentially HTML and JavaScript together. As a
              module solution, your only option is existing JavaScript modules, and you don't even have to use those. So
              if you've use module. exports or import from, this is what I'm talking about.</p>
            <p>If you want to integrate Vue and make it just one part of your application, but make the rest of the
              application something else, this is easy. And we tend to see the highest productivity with Vue when we're
              building an application that's medium size, not too small, not too big. And you'll recall that when we
              want to add functionality, we use directives like v-for and v-if.</p>
            <p>Now as for Angular, learning and using Angular is no simple task. Not only does Angular have modules and
              many other tricky things, but you also need to write it in TypeScript. TypeScript is confusing enough as
              it is, so you kind of have to master it before you can even master Angular. It's fun, but let me tell you,
              it's not easy.</p>
            <p>Now Angular uses JavaScript modules, but it also on top of that has its own module solution called
              Angular Modules, which are cool, but they're also a lot of work to learn as well. Now Angular doesn't
              really play nice with other frameworks. Angular wants to be the chief framework on your page. So while it
              is technically possible, you generally don't look at Angular as the solution to say I'm just going to
              replace one tiny part of my app with Angular. For starters, the library is very large.</p>
            <p>Speaking of large, one thing that Angular does have is that for really big applications, we're talking
              huge, it's just better suited to building them in Vue. Really all the decisions about Angular are kind of
              geared towards these very, very large projects. That's why some things like Angular Modules might seem too
              confusing. Well, they are for small projects, but for big projects, they're a lifesaver.</p>
            <p>Lastly, if we want to add functionality with directives, we can do them with stuff like ng-for and ng-if.
              Ng-for and ng-if. Those sound very familiar to our Vue directives. In fact, Vue took a lot of queues from
              Angular on how to name and design their directive, so anyone who understands Angular will recognize these
              Vue directives. So I've done a good job of making Vue sound great, but in the next clip, we're going to
              see why Vue might not be so great. </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Vue Pitfalls and Drawbacks </h3>
            <p> I'll be the first to admit that my praise of Vue has been lavish, but don't fear because I'm not looking
              at Vue through rose-colored glasses. I've definitely taken some time to think about why Vue might not be
              the best for your solution, and surely it is not right for every project. So what are some drawbacks of
              Vue .</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig04-014.png" />
              <figcaption>Fig 04-014</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>So first of all, Vue needs support from its ecosystem to do a lot of things. Once you get past that
              prototype step, you're really going to want to start using these libraries, and once you do, Vue is no
              longer a matter of just being a simple, tiny library. You're getting into dependencies and complexity that
              rivals that of an Angular or React application.</p>
            <p>Next, Vue has some tricky reactivity. This is because they try and make it quite magical in the way that
              the components respond to data being changed. Compare this to React, which does no such thing. You have to
              tell react to render every time. It's very unmagical. So there's no shortage of scenarios where your
              components might not update in the way you expect. You have to learn to play around these scenarios.</p>
            <p>Next, while it is true that if your developer is familiar with Vue, they'll find the Vue file type easy
              to use, but if you have a developer who's never heard of Vue, then the file type may be confusing. It
              isn't like anything else out there. Finally, while there are production applications using Vue today,
              compared to React and Angular, it is very new, and there are many scenarios which haven't been tested.
              Probably they will work, but you're taking a bit of a risk there, and I consider that a drawback.</p>
            <p>So let's say at the end of the day you've chosen not to use Vue, but to use React or Angular. Why would
              you have made such a choice?</p>
            <figure> <img src="images/vue-js-big-picture/Fig04-015.png" />

            </figure>
            <p>Well, Vue is less established. There's fewer existing resources. Maybe you find the fact that Angular and
              React have a huge amount of English language documentation quite comforting, and that's why you've chosen
              to use it. A fair decision.</p>
            <p>In addition, perhaps you're worried by the fact that many scenarios in production just haven't been
              tested very much, and if you're the first person ever to try this with Vue, then you'll be the one testing
              it and paying the cost if it doesn't work.</p>
            <p>Lastly, if you're building an application and you know from the beginning that it's going to be huge,
              we're talking enterprise, then you wouldn't be blamed for choosing Angular or React instead of Vue.
              They're both geared for projects that are a little bit larger.</p>
            <p>So that's it. At the end of the day, there's not really a lot of drawbacks, but they're there, and
              consider them when you try to decide if Vue is right for your project. In the last and final clip, outside
              of the conclusion, I'll be talking a bit more about the build step. </p>
