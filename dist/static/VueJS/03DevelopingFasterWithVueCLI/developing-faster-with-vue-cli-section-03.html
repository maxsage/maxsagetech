            <h3>Setting up the Vue CLI</h3>
            <p>
              Before we kick it into high gear, it's important to know how to set up the Vue CLI so you can be set up
              for success. So in this module, we'll talk about what you need to set up the Vue CLI, which of course
              includes installing the prerequisites. We'll go through what those are and then we'll check how you can
              make sure that you installed the right versions, which is also important in case new versions come out so
              you can make sure you know how to look at those versions to then update them to the latest versions.</p>
            <p>Once we verify the versions, we'll then check out if the setup actually works for us, and we'll do that
              by creating a Vue application. We'll do this twice actually in a couple different ways just so we can make
              sure everything is working properly. Once we do that, we can have high confidence that we are ready to
              roll.
            </p></div>
          <div>
            <h3>Installing the Vue CLI</h3>
            <p>The first step with installing the CLI is of course to make sure you have the prerequisites. Here we're
              going to use Node, and you'll go to the nodejs. org URL to get this:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig02-001.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 02-001</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I recommend downloading the LTS version for your particular operating system. LTS stands for long-term
              support. And then once you get that, you can then install Node locally on your machine.</p>
            <p>Next, we want to install the Vue CLI itself:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">npm install, -g @vue/cli.</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 02-002</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>@Vue is the scope for the view packages. This will put the package globally on our machine using npm. If
              you happen to roll with Yarn, you could use Yarn to do the same thing by doing:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">yarn global add @vue/cli.</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 02-003</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now depending upon your network connection to npm and the world, this may take a few seconds or up to a
              minute. Once you get that, I highly recommend you verify your installation works. There's a couple things
              you can do. The most simplest is to do:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue --version</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 02-004</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This will tell you the version of the CLI that you just installed. When I recorded this course, it was 3.
              2. 1. Now the version is important, but also obviously if I can do vue --version, that means that the Vue
              CLI is there. Make sure that you've got the latest version of the CLI, and you can check the Vue docs to
              look at that.</p>
            <p>Then check the version of Node, make sure that we installed the version that you thought you installed by
              doing:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">node --version</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 02-005</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The current minimum at the time of recording this course is 8. 9, but you'll always want to check the Vue
              docs for updated information. You can find that link right here. And finally, I like to just make sure
              that I've got a version of npm that I'm aware of:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">npm --version</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 02-006</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and currently that is 6. 4. 1. When you get Node by default, it brings npm with you for now. That could
              change in the future, you never know. If you're using Yarn, make sure you've got the most recent version
              of Yarn as well. Well now it's time to actually walk through and install and verify those same things.
              Let's do this together. </p></div>
          <div>
            <h3>Install and Verify</h3>
            <p>
              Before getting started in installing, I've mentioned the Vue CLI docs a few times. So let's go to that
              page and make sure we know what we're installing because we always want to check to see what the latest
              versions are.</p>
            <p>So here I go to <a href="cli.vuejs.org">cli.vuejs.org</a> and there's a big button down here called Get
              Started:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig02-007.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 02-007</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>When I click on that, we're brought right to the overview. We want to go to Installation, which we'll
              click on here in the left, and the first thing is a nice warning that we should make sure we're using the
              proper version of CLI:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig02-008.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 02-008</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The Vue CLI 3, version 3, was refactored and renamed using the scoping, and that's what we're using here
              in this course. So moving forward, all the versions of the CLI will be @vue/cli. So make sure that's the
              one you're installing.</p>
            <p>It also mentions here the Node version requirement:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig02-009.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 02-009</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I imagine as this evolves this will also be updated, so always check here to make sure you have the
              proper version of Node. Then below we see how we can install with npm and Yarn and then check the version.
              Now let's go take a look at Node. We could click on this button here or I've already got it opened. This
              is the main page of Node:</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Fig02-010.png"/>
              <figcaption>Fig 02-010</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>and we can see that it recognizes I'm using a Mac, and I'm going to click on the LTS button here to
              download that version. Once it downloads that, I can then double-click it and then install Node on my
              machine and follow the prompts that it gives you.</p>
            <p>Once installed, we can flip over to a terminal and we can run commands like:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">node --version</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 02-011</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>We can see the version there. And we can also check out our npm version:</p>
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">npm --version</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 02-012</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now both of these also support -v to just check the version as well.</p>
            <p>Next, we want to install the Vue CLI:
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">npm install -g @vue/cli</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 02-013</figcaption>
              </figure>
            <p>And then we'll install the Vue CLI together. Once installed, we'll type:
              <figure>
                <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue --version</code></pre>
                <figcaption>Fig 02-014</figcaption>
              </figure>
            <p>and there we go. And that's all you need to do to make sure the CLI is installed along with Node as its
              prerequisite.
            </p></div>

          <h3>Creating Apps with the Vue CLI</h3>
          <p>Before we can confidently say that we've got the Vue CLI set up correctly, we want to make sure we can
            create an application and it works. So let's do this together. What we're going to do is create and serve an
            app. So we'll run the vue create command, specify the name to be hello-cli, and then use the default
            options:</p>
          <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue create hello-cli -d</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-015</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>so we just avoid the prompts for now that the CLI would give us and give us a default application. We're
            just testing this out.</p>
          <p>We'll change the directory to go to the new folder we created:</p>
          <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-command-line">cd hello-cli</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-016</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>and then we'll run:</p>
          <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-command-line">npm run serve</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-017</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>and then browse to the location where it opens our application inside of our browser.</p>
          <p>Once we do this for the CLI, we'll also use the Vue CLI's UI to do the same thing to make sure both of them
            work properly. Now grab your keyboards and let's try this out together.</p>
          <p>Inside of a terminal, we can then check to make sure we have the right version of Vue. I like to do that
            just to make sure I've got it installed here. We'll type:</p>
          <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue create hello-cli -d</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-018</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Like this, and I'll put the -d on there for the default options.</p>
          <p>Once the CLI is completed, it gives us the instructions at the bottom and tells us to go into the hello-cli
            folder, we'll do that now:
            <figure>
              <pre><code class="language-command-line">cd hello-cli</code></pre>
              <figcaption>Fig 02-019</figcaption>
            </figure>
          <p>then type</p>
          <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-command-line">npm run serve</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-020</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Once we do that, it builds the application, and it then will tell us where to launch the browser, right
            here at localhost 8080, and then I'll open that up inside my browser and here is our application:</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig02-011.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-011</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Perfect. Next, I'm going to cancel out of here and we're going to back out to a new folder again, and this
            time I'm going to create a different project. And to do that I'm going to type:</p>
          <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-command-line">vue ui</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-012</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>So now it's going to start the GUI for the Vue CLI right here in the browser, and notice hello-cli if I
            come back to it and I refresh, it's not running anymore:</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig02-013.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-013</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>And let's go full screen. Then I'm going to click on the Home button in the bottom left. Now here we can
            see we already had one called hello-world:</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig02-014.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-014</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>You may have others on your machine as well. I'm going to click Create up here in the middle. It's then
            asking where do you want to create this. I don't want to create it in hello-world, I want to create it
            inside my play vue folder. So I'll click on that folder:</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig02-015.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-015</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Now I'm going to click on Create a new project. We want to type the name of the project. In this case we're
            going to type hello-cli-ui, and then we're going to keep all the defaults and click on Next:</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig02-016.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-016</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Notice now we can start selecting our options:</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig02-017.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-017</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>We're going to choose Default again, which is basically the same as doing the -d flag like we did from the
            terminal. Now we're clicking on Create Project. Once the project has been completely installed, we can now
            see a Welcome page:</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig02-018.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-018</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>and it tells us over on the left there's additional things that we can do.</p>
          <p>We'll run over to the Tasks right here in this icon, and then we can click on serve, and we'll just click
            on the defaults for running it:</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig02-019.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-019</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>and it's going to run this serve task, same thing as when we do npm run serve in the command line. We can
            also click on the Open app button over here once it's done. We know it's done because it's been idle for 2
            seconds and it's running and everything is green, and there is our default app:</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig02-020.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-020</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>And now we have a high level of confidence that we can create Vue apps from the CLI and the CLI's UI. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Summary and Next Steps</h3>
          <p>
            Congratulations, you just verified and set up the Vue CLI. Now you're ready to roll. To recap, we installed
            Node. js, our prerequisite for running the Vue CLI. Then installed the Vue CLI either using npm or Yarn, and
            then we verified our setup and of course created our first two apps, hello-cli and hello-cli-ui.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Fig02-021.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 02-021</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>And this module was left intentionally short so we can show how simple it is to install the different tools
            that we need to run the Vue CLI. In the next module, we'll take a look at some other development tools that
            we can use to enhance the Vue development experience along with the Vue CLI.
