          <h3>Image Module Design</h3>
          <p>I think that we've got a good handle on navigation and authentication inside of our app. Now that those
            systems are under wraps we are going to move forward and think about how we are going to attempt to retrieve
            a list of images from the Imgur API and handle the upload process. We will take care of fetching images
            first. We will use the Imgur site's upload form to upload some initial images. We should then be able to
            come back over to our application and see those images appear on the ImageList component. Let's discuss the
            initial design of our Images module. Remember we've worked on one Vuex module so far - the Auth module.
            Inside that module we defined:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>state</li>
            <li>getters</li>
            <li>actions</li>
            <li>mutations</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We are going to add a completely separate module inside of our Vuex <span class="filename">modules</span>
            folder which is going to be related to working with the images resource. This module will handle fetching
            images (like the list of images we have as a user) and also work around uploading images as well. Let's take
            a look at a diagram that's going to walk us through the design of this module. </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="./images/vuejsessentials/Fig07-001.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-001</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>The first thing we are going to think about is the state of this module. Remember the state is kind of like
            the very raw data that we're going to be working with inside this module. For this particular case when we
            reach out to the Imgur API to get a list of images that have been uploaded by our present user the Imgur API
            is going to send back a big array of objects to us - each object inside that array is going to represent one
            uploaded image - so in essence it's going to be very similar to the YouTube API we worked with earlier in
            the course. When we start thinking about our state design it's going to make a lot of sense to just have a
            single property called <code class="language-">images</code> and this will point to an array that contains
            a list of all the images that we've fetched from the Imgur API. Initially the array will be empty:</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="./images/vuejsessentials/Fig07-002.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-002</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>For the getters all we're doing is showing a list of all of the images that the user has uploaded on
            screen. We are not performing any filtering or advanced computation or anything like that. We will have just
            one getter called <code class="language-">allImages</code> . If someone calls this getter we just going
            return back to them a list of all the images inside inside of our state </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="./images/vuejsessentials/Fig07-003.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-003</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>In the case of actions, our application really has two primary purposes to it. On the one hand we should
            have the ability to fetch a list of all of our images. Secondly we should have the ability to upload an
            image because that's really the two big aspects of our application that we're trying to implement:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="./images/vuejsessentials/Fig07-004.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-004</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>We are going to be in a similar situation here with <code class="language-">uploadImage</code> to what we
            had in the Auth module. In the Auth module we put together that <code class="language-">login</code>
            action - which didn't actually modify our state or call any mutations. It's actually going be very similar
            in this case as well. <code class="language-">uploadImage</code> is going to attempt to take an image or
            multiple images and upload them to the Imgur API. There's probably not a lot of stuff beyond that the <code
              class="language-">uploadImage</code> action really needs to do because whenever we upload an image -
            that's going to be on the upload form and the <code class="language-">uploadImage</code> action is going
            to have no reason to ever try to modify the state object.
          </p>
          <p>On the other hand we have <code class="language-">fetchImages</code> which without doubt is going to have
            to call a mutation to update the <code class="language-">images</code> piece of state. We will create a
            mutation called <code class="language-">setImages</code> that will be something very similar to the <code
              class="language-">setToken</code> mutation that we had in the Auth module: </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="./images/vuejsessentials/Fig07-005.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-005</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>We'll say that after the <code class="language-">fetchImages</code> action makes a network request over
            to the Imgur API to get a list of all of our images it should call the <code
              class="language-">setImages</code> mutation and attempt to update the list of images stored inside of
            our state. The design of this module is going to be very similar to the Auth module we worked on earlier .
            So this will be a good opportunity to reinforce a lot of the stuff that we just learned.</p>
          <h3>Module Implementation</h3>
          <p>In the <span class="filename">modules</span> directory create a new file called <span class="filename">images.js</span>
            and add the following boilerplate code:</p>
          <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const state = {
    images: []
};

const getters = {
    allImages: state =&gt; state.images
};

const actions = {
    fetchImages() {}
};

const mutations = {
    setImages: (state, images) =&gt; {
        state.images = images;
    }
};
</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-006</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>The <code class="language-">allImages</code> getter is a function that gets called with our <code
            class="language-">state</code> object and all we want to do is return the list of <code
            class="language-">images</code> from <code
            class="language-">state</code> . The <code
            class="language-">setImages</code> mutation gets called with an array of image objects. We just take the
            entire array and update the value of <code class="language-">images</code> replacing what is already
            there. Remember that when this gets called we first have our current <code class="language-">state</code>
            object and then any optional arguments - in this case the array of images that comes back from the Imgur
            API. We take that array and assign it to <code class="language-">state.images</code> . As we said
            previously most of the mutations that we put together inside of a Vuex application are going to be very
            straightforward in nature because they are specifically designed to be very small, very discrete changes to
            our state object so it will be rare to do a lot of complicated stuff here. Instead we try to put any
            complicated business logic we have into an action object. With <code class="language-">fetchImages</code>
            action we just add the function stub. We will look at the functionality inside <code class="language-">fetchImages</code>
            in the next section.</p>
          <h3>Fetch Images API Documentation</h3>
          <p>The purpose of the <code class="language-">fetchImages</code> action is to reach out to the Imgur API and
            retrieve any images that this user has ever uploaded. There are a couple of different considerations here.
            First off we have to think about where we are going to locate the code to make this actual API request.
            Secondly we have to think about how we actually fetch the images at all.</p>
          <p>The Imgur API <a target="_blank" href="apidocs.imgur.com">documentation</a> has a section on Account which
            lists all the different API endpoints that are tied to a users account. We are looking for Account Images
            which returns all the images that have been uploaded by the current user. To get the list of images we
            perform a GET request to <code class="language-">https://api.imgur.com/3/account/me/images</code>. What's
            very important to note here is that we have to send along a very specific header on the request as well. The
            Header has to include the <code class="language-">access_token</code> that we obtained when we went
            through the OAuth process in order to access the user's list of images.</p>
          <h3>Fetching Images</h3>
          <p>In the <span class="filename">imgur.js</span> file located in the <span class="filename">api</span>
            directory:</p>
          <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import qs from 'qs';
const CLIENT_ID = 'c3feb8623a2803b';
const ROOT_URL = 'https://api.imgur.com';

export default {
    login() {
        const querystring = {
            client_id: CLIENT_ID,
            response_type: 'token'
        };

        window.location = `${ROOT_URL}/oauth2/authorize?${qs.stringify(querystring )}`;
    }
};</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-007</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>You'll recall that we created the <code class="language-">default</code> object that houses a couple of
            different functions related to working with the Imgur API. Add a new function under the <code
              class="language-">login</code> action:</p>
          <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">fetchImages() {
    return axios.get(`${ROOT_URL}/3/account/me/images`)
  }</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-008</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>We also need to import the axios library:</p>
          <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">import axios from 'axios';</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-009</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Remember we use that library to make network requests off to arbitrary endpoints. The <code
            class="language-">fetchImages</code> function makes a GET request using axios. We use string interpolation
            to concatenate our <code class="language-">ROOT_URL</code> with the remainder of the address for the
            Account Images endpoint. This will make the GET request over to the Imgur API. However at this point we are
            not passing the required information in the Header of the request. First of all we will add a Header to the
            axios request and then after that we will look at how we get access to the actual <code class="language-">access_token</code>
            from the <code class="language-">fetchImages</code> action. The first argument to the GET request is the
            actual Url that we want to make the request to and then the second argument is going to be an object that
            can have a collection of different options that customize the request that we're making. One possible option
            we could pass in here is a <code class="language-">headers</code> object:</p>
          <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">fetchImages(token) {
    return axios.get(`${ROOT_URL}/3/account/me/images`, {
        headers: {
            Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
        }
    })
  }</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-010</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>This is going to be a list of different headers that we're going to include along with the request. We
            follow the specifications laid out in the documentation by adding a key of <code class="language-">Authorization</code>.
            The value that we specify is a template string - <code class="language-">`Bearer ${}`</code>. We want to
            add the <code class="language-">access_token</code> between the curly braces so, for the moment, we make
            the assumption that when we call the <code class="language-">fetchImages</code> function from within our
            images module we can pass the <code class="language-">access_token</code> in as an argument. We will
            figure out how to get the <code class="language-">access_token</code> into that module shortly.
          </p>
          <h3>Communicating Across Modules</h3>
          <p>In the last section we put together our <code class="language-">fetchImages</code> function inside of
            imgur helper. We want to call this function from the <code class="language-">fetchImages</code> action
            inside of our images module. We want to get our access token over to this function. Remember that you and I
            are working inside of the Images module:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="./images/vuejsessentials/Fig07-011.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-011.png</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>However our token is saved inside the Auth module - which is a totally separate piece of state inside of
            our overall Vuex instance. So inside of <span class="filename">images.js</span> we import our <code
              class="language-">api</code> :</p>
          <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">import api from '../../api/imgur';</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-012</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Then inside of the <code class="language-">fetchImages</code> function we can use our api that we just
            imported to call <code
              class="language-">api.fetchImages();</code></p>
          <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const actions = {
  fetchImages() {
      api.fetchImages();
  }
};</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-013</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>In order to reach out to that totally different module and get information out of it the <code
            class="language-">fetchImages</code> action gets called with a first argument that, as we've discussed a
            couple of times now, is going to give us the ability to reach into other modules inside of our application.
            Previously, remember when we defined that first argument inside of an action we said it was an object with a
            couple of different properties. So, for example, in the Auth module the <code class="language-">finalizeLogin</code>
            and <code class="language-">logout</code> actions both make use of the <code
              class="language-">commit</code> function which allows us to call a mutation. Another property that
            exists on that first argument is called <code class="language-">rootState</code> :</p>
          <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const actions = {
  fetchImages({ rootState }) {
      api.fetchImages();
  }
};</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-014</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p><code class="language-">rootState</code> is a reference to all of the state that is held inside of our
            Vuex store or instance. So <code class="language-">rootState</code> here gives us the ability to reach
            into other modules and access state or access data that is held inside them. The <code class="language-">rootState</code>
            object is going to have different properties assigned to it based on how you have hooked up your modules to
            your Vuex instance. Let me explain what I mean by that. If you recall inside the <span class="filename">store</span>
            directory we've got that <span class="filename">index.js</span> file inside of which we created our Vuex
            instance and wired up our Auth module as a module called simply auth:
          </p>
          <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">export default new Vuex.Store({
  modules: {
      auth
  }
});</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-015</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Because we hooked the Auth module up to the store as a module called <code
            class="language-">auth</code> above, we can access the state inside of this Auth module by writing out
            <code class="language-">rootState.auth</code> and then whatever property we want off that state object.
            Our Auth module has only one property on it's data object - the <code class="language-">token</code>
            property. So we use the following code in our Images module to reach over into that Auth module and pull the
            token out of that Auth module state:
          </p>
          <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const actions = {
    fetchImages({ rootState }) {
        rootState.auth.token;
        api.fetchImages();
    }
};</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-016</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>I'm going to use ES2015 destructuring syntax to clean up the code a little bit:</p>
          <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">const { token } = rootState.auth;</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-017</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>So now we can take that token that we've got from the module and pass it along to the <code
            class="language-">fetchImages</code> function that we put together inside of the <span class="filename">imgur.js</span>
            api helper file:
          </p>
          <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const actions = {
    fetchImages({ rootState }) {
        const { token } = rootState.auth;
        api.fetchImages(token);
    }
  };</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-018</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Next in the <span class="filename">imgur.js</span> api file in the <code
            class="language-">fetchImages</code> function where we make the axios request:</p>
          <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">fetchImages(token) {
        return axios.get(`${ROOT_URL}/3/account/me/images`, {
            headers: {
                Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
            }
        })
  }</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-019</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Note - we are returning the request from the function. So back inside of the images module when we call
            <code class="language-">api.fetchImages(token);</code> because we are calling an asynchronous request we
            have to write a little bit of code to handle the response that comes back. Previously in the VideoBrowser
            application when we made a request, we interfaced with that request by using a promise. However, this time
            around we are going to follow the convention of Vuex a little bit more closely by using an async await
            syntax here instead to wait for this api request to be completed:
          </p>
          <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const actions = {
  async fetchImages({ rootState }) {
      const { token } = rootState.auth;
      const response = await api.fetchImages(token);
  }
};</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-020</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Firstly we mark <code class="language-">fetchImages</code> with the <code
            class="language-">async</code> keyword then we add the <code class="language-">await</code> keyword in
            front of the api call. Then we store the response in a variable called <code
              class="language-">response</code>. Finally when we get this response back it should have a list of all
            the images inside of our application we will eventually call commit. Before call commit and actually store
            these images inside of our module I think it would probably be a really good experience to console log out
            the response object to get a better idea of what information we get back from the Imgur API:</p>
          <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const actions = {
    async fetchImages({ rootState }) {
        const { token } = rootState.auth;
        const response = await api.fetchImages(token);
        console.log(response);
    }
  };</code></pre>

          <h3>Testing Images Response</h3>
          <p>In this section we're going to wire up the Images module to our Vuex store and then we'll wire up all that
            stuff to our ImageList component and attempt to reach out to the Imgur API and get a list of all of our
            images. Again, the first thing we have to do is make sure that we export our <code
              class="language-">state</code> , <code class="language-">getters</code> , <code class="language-">actions</code>
            and <code class="language-">mutations</code> from this module file. At the bottom add the following <code
              class="language-">export</code>

            statement:</p>
          <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">export default {
  state,
  getters,
  actions,
  mutations
}</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-022</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>And just like before the names of each of these objects right here are especially important. Next in <span
            class="filename">index.js</span> file we create our Vuex instance and import the Images module:
          </p>
          <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">import images from './modules/images';</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-023</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Next we'll hook that module up inside the <code class="language-">modules</code> object to tell Vuex
            about the additional module we have created:</p>
          <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">export default new Vuex.Store({
  modules: {
      auth,
      images
  }
});</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-024</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>The next thing we have to do is actually take that <code class="language-">store</code> , take the <code
            class="language-">action</code> inside of it and call it from one of the functions inside our lifecycle
            methods inside our components. The chances are that we only want to attempt to load up our list of images
            from the Imgur API when we are showing the ImageList component on the screen. In the ImageList component we
            make use of the <code class="language-">created()</code> lifecycle method. First off though let's setup
            <code class="language-">mapActions</code> for fetching images. Add the <code
              class="language-">import</code> statement for <code class="language-">mapActions</code> :</p>
          <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">import { mapActions } from 'vuex';</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-025</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Next we will wire up the <code class="language-">fetchImages</code> action and wire it up to this
            component's <code class="language-">methods</code> property. We define the <code class="language-">methods</code>
            property and call <code class="language-">mapActions</code> passing in an array containing the name of the
            action that we want merge into our ImageList component - <code class="language-">fetchImages</code> :
          </p>
          <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">export default {
    name: 'ImageList',
    methods: mapActions(['fetchImages']),
  }</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-025</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>And as we were just saying we also want to define a lifecycle method because the instant we are about to
            load this component up we want to attempt to reach out to the Imgur API and fetch our list of images so we
            can show them on the screen. Underneath our <code class="language-">methods</code> definition I'll add in
            our <code class="language-">created</code> function which will be called automatically because it is
            called <code class="language-">created</code> . Inside the lifecycle method we can fetch our images:</p>
          <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">export default {
  name: 'ImageList',
  methods: mapActions(['fetchImages']),
  created() {
      this.fetchImages();
  }
}</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-026</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>We are just about ready to test this out inside the browser. One thing I want to remind you about is that
            we have not yet gone through the process of uploading any images. So while we may be able to run this code
            inside the browser I really don't expect to see any images come back on the api. However I would like to run
            this code just to verify we are not getting any errors. In the browser make sure you are on the Image List -
            <code class="language-">localhost:8080</code> and logged in. Click on the Network tab inside chrome
            devtools, filter by XHR requests and then refresh the entire page. At this point we have not yet setup our
            application to work correctly if you're not logged in when it comes to fetching this list of images. When
            you refresh you should see a GET request to the images endpoint at Imgur. You'll notice that there's two
            requests inside of here. The first one is an options type request. This is to handle the fact that we are
            making a network request across domain - also referred to as a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) request.
            The second one is our actual request that tries to fetch some information. If we select that and then view
            the preview tab you'll notice that we got back data of empty array:</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="./images/vuejsessentials/Fig07-027.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-027</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>This means we fetched no images. Also in the console log we've got the entire response object with the
            <code class="language-">data</code> property:</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="./images/vuejsessentials/Fig07-028.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-028</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>One thing that's going to be really confusing here, and this is why I wanted to do the console log, is that
            whenever we make a request with axios the response comes back with a <code class="language-">data</code>
            property that contains data that was sent back to us by the remote api. The reason this is really confusing
            is that when Imgurs API in particular sends a response back to us - there response object has a <code
              class="language-">data</code> property nested inside of it as well. The first <code class="language-">data</code>
            object shown in Fig 07-028 is from axios behaving as usual saying whatever information we get back is going
            to be on the <code class="language-">data</code> property. Inside there is a second <code
              class="language-">data</code> property that is being returned by Imgurs API - they just decided to call
            this property <code class="language-">data</code> as well and they decided to return the results of our
            query inside that <code class="language-">data</code> property. In other words we've got <code
              class="language-">data.data</code> these two nested data properties which is a bit confusing but we'll
            get around that.</p>
          <h3>Image Upload via Imgur</h3>
          <p>Upload an image or images to <a href="imgur.com">imgur.com</a> and then refresh the browser of your
            application at <code class="language-">localhost:8080</code> . If you look at the Network tab again and
            select the images GET request you should see that the <code class="language-">data</code> object contains
            a single object. </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="./images/vuejsessentials/Fig07-029.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-029</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>You can expand the node to see various details about the image such as the date and time it was uploaded,
            the dimensions, type of image, and (most relevant for us) a direct link to the image.</p>
          <h3>Committing Images to State</h3>
          <p>We are now able to successfully retrieve a list of images from the Imgur API and the last thing we have to
            do inside of our images module is to make sure that we complete the code fo our <code class="language-">fetchImages</code>
            action. We got back our response object that contains our images but we need to make sure that we call that
            <code class="language-">setImages</code> mutation to update the list of images that are stored inside of
            our <code class="language-">state</code> object. Remember how we do that from the first argument:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">async fetchImages({ rootState }) </code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-030</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>We are going to pull off the <code class="language-">commit</code> function in addition to the <code
            class="language-">rootState</code> object. The <code class="language-">rootState</code> object gives us
            access to state within other modules:</p>
          <figure>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">const actions = {
  async fetchImages({ rootState, commit }) {
      const { token } = rootState.auth;
      const response = await api.fetchImages(token);
  }
 };</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-031</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>We also remove the <code class="language-">console.log</code> statement and call <code
            class="language-">commit</code> instead:</p>
          <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const actions = {
    async fetchImages({ rootState, commit }) {
        const { token } = rootState.auth;
        const response = await api.fetchImages(token);
        commit('setImages', response.data.data);
    }
  };</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-032</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>The first argument to <code class="language-">commit</code> is a string that tells Vuex which mutation we
            are trying to call - so in this case <code class="language-">setImages</code>. The second argument we
            provide is the new list of images to store inside of our state - <code class="language-">response.data.data</code>.
            We are now getting back our list of image(s) and storing them inside our ImageList modules <code
              class="language-">state</code> object.</p>
          <h3>Mapping the Images Getter</h3>
          <p>Our Images module is now taking our list of images back from the Imgur API and storing them on our Images
            module <code class="language-">state</code> . We are now going to move over to our ImageList component and
            make sure that the component is aware of all the images that are being fetched by our api. At present we are
            only calling the action to fetch the images. Now remember these actions attempt to modify our <code
              class="language-">state</code> in some fashion. To actually get information out of our <code
              class="language-">state</code> object we have to make use of <code class="language-">getters</code> .
            Remember inside of our Images module we made that <code class="language-">getter</code> called <code
              class="language-">allImages</code> which returns all the images that are stored inside of our <code
              class="language-">state</code> object. So we want to take the <code class="language-">allImages</code>
            getter and map it to our ImageList component. To do so we are going to <code
              class="language-">import</code> our <code class="language-">mapGetters</code> function:</p>
          <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">import { mapActions, mapGetters } from 'vuex';</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-033A</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>and add it to our component definitions <code class="language-">computed</code> property:</p>
          <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">computed: mapGetters(['allImages',  'isLoggedIn']),</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-033B</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>We use a <code class="language-">computed</code> property to read information into our component and make
            it accessible from our actual template. Now that we've got the list of images inside of here we can
            reference that list of images inside of our template as we please. So for now, I'll just print out the
            number of images that are being fetched from the API:
          </p>
          <figure>
          <pre v-pre><code class="language-html">&lt;template&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        Image List

        {{ allImages.length }}
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-034</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>If you now view the application now you should see the number of images returned from the API:</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="./images/vuejsessentials/Fig07-035.png"/>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-035.png</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <h3>Listing Images</h3>
          <p>We've now got a list of all of our images inside our ImageList component. Inside this section we are going
            to put in a little bit of temporary code here just to loop over all the images that we fetched and print
            them out to the screen. Now the first take that we're going to do is going to be a little bit ugly but we
            just want to get some temporary solution in here. We'll then go and take care of the UploadForm and then
            we're going to come back to this once we have the ability to upload a lot of images and we'll do something
            way more interesting to display our images on the screen. Firstly, clear out the contents of the <code
              class="language-">div</code> in the ImageList component and replace it with the following code:</p>
          <figure>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;template&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;img v-for=&quot;image in allImages&quot; :src=&quot;image.link&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/template&gt;</code></pre>
            <figcaption>Fig 07-036</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>We use the <code class="language-">v-for</code> directive to loop over all the different images that we
            fetch and display one <code class="language-">img</code> tag for each image. Remember how we use the <code
              class="language-">v-for</code> directive - we write out <code
              class="language-">v-for</code> and then a temporary variable name (in this case <code
              class="language-">image</code> ), then the <code
              class="language-"> in</code> keyword, then the name of the collection of records that we want to iterate
            over which in this case is <code
              class="language-">allImages</code> Then inside the tag that contains the <code
              class="language-">v-for</code> directive we can use the temporary variable (<code class="language-">image</code>)
            for any other purpose we might want. So in the context of an <code class="language-">img</code> tag we
            probably want to define the <code class="language-">src</code> property. Remember that anytime we want to
            pass in a <code class="language-">src</code> property or any Html property to an element and we want to
            ensure that the property comes from a variable we have to make use of the <code
              class="language-">v-bind</code> syntax. If we now view this in the browser we should see the image is
            displaying as expected.</p>
