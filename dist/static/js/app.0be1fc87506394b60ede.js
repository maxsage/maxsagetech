First off,\n            data binding is one of the more powerful XAML platform features and it's certainly not limited to just WPF.\n            A lot of the things we're going to be talking about in this course apply equally to Windows 8 development,\n            Windows Phone development, and even the somewhat defunct Silverlight.

So the data model\n            objects that get loaded up with data and that you're going to use to ultimately drive what you see on the\n            screen, the view doesn't need to be tightly coupled to exactly what type of objects those are, how they get\n            populated, where they're held in memory, and so on.\n          ")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("\n            Additionally, you can keep the View decoupled from the data access that populates those data models, so\n            whether you get objects over service calls, go directly out to a relational database, load them up from flat\n            files, the View doesn't have to know anything about that. And most specifically, when we're talking about\n            View here, we really mean the elements within the View that represent the renderable content that you see on\n            screen.

Now to fully achieve\n            that, you really have to take a step further and consider something like the Model-View-ViewModel pattern,\n            but it's really data binding that makes that possible.\n          ")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("\n            Additionally, data binding reduces the overall amount of code you'll have to write and you'll see that in\n            the demos towards the end of the module.

One is that the automatic\n            data flow to and from the screen that data binding enables, means that you have to write less code to\n            explicitly push and pull data from individual properties on elements within the screen.\n          ")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("\n            Additionally, just in terms of conceptualizing and implementing the code, it allows you to form natural\n            associations between data objects and their properties and screen elements that are going to render out the\n            content of those objects.\n          ")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("\n            One of the other benefits of data binding is it facilitates a developer-designer workflow.

Let's say we want to put a Silver\n                    BoxView 20 units below this Aqua BoxView. After specifying the BoxView element and a Color of Silver add\n                    an attached bindable property RelativeLayout.YConstraint. This time for the ConstraintExpression we specify\n                    a Type of RelativeToView because this time I want to apply the YConstraint based on the Aqua BoxView. This\n                    is something we cannot achieve with absolute layout - we cannot set the position or size of an element based\n                    on another element. We need to identify which View we are referring to. We do this by giving the Aqua BoxView\n                    a name (banner). Back in the Silver BoxView we will use another property called ElementName which we set\n                    to banner. Next we specify the property of the banner we are interested in - in this case it's Height - we\n                    want to get the Height and add 20 units to it to set the Y coordinate of the Silver BoxView. Next we set the\n                    Factor to 1. Finally we set the Constant property to 20 units. This means the Y coordinate of the Silver\n                    BoxView will be the height of the Banner times 1 plus 20. The Constant property can also be set to a\n                    negative value")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("Now let's look at the result:")]),e._v(" "),a("figure",[a("img",{attrs:{src:n("II3y")}}),e._v(" "),a("figcaption",[e._v("Fig 03-066")])]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("So you see our Silver BoxView is 20 units below the Aqua BoxView.
