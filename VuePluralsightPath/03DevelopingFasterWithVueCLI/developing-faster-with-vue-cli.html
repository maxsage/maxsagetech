              <h3>Course Overview</h3>
              <p>(Music) Hi everyone. My name is John Papa. Welcome to my course, Developing Faster with the Vue CLI.
                I'm a web architect and JavaScript developer expert, and I'm very excited to share this course with
                you. This course gently introduces how to create, debug, test, build, serve, and extend Vue
                applications using the Vue CLI and popular Vue developer tools. You will learn how to hone your Vue
                skills and develop great apps quickly. Some of the major topics that we will cover include creating
                and customizing a new Vue application; building Vue apps, libraries and web components; debugging Vue
                applications with Chrome and Visual Studio Code; extending your Vue app with Vue CLI plugins such as
                Vuex, ESLint, and Progressive Web Apps; and learning the Vue CLI's UI, a graphical user interface for
                interacting with the Vue CLI. By the end of this course, you'll have learned these concepts and more,
                and be well on your way to building Vue apps. Before beginning this course, you should be familiar
                with JavaScript, but you don't have to be an expert by any means. Please join me on this journey to
                learn the Vue CLI, with the Developing Faster with the Vue CLI course, on Pluralsight. We hope you
                enjoy it. </p></div>

              Vue CLI</h2>

                <h3>Introducing the Vue CLI</h3>
                <p>Hi, my name's John Papa. Welcome to my new course, Developing Faster with the Vue CLI. Thanks for
                  joining me here at Pluralsight. In this first module, we're going to get started with the Vue CLI.
                  We'll start by learning what the Vue CLI does for you, and then of course why you should use the Vue
                  CLI, and then we'll go through a couple different demos or tours, the first of which is touring the
                  zero configuration options, which help us get started quickly. And then we'll tour the Vue CLI itself.
                  And finally, we'll take a look at the Vue CLI's UI. Yeah, you heard that right. The Vue CLI has a user
                  interface, and it has some pretty impressive features, so let's dive right in. </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Creating a Vue App with the Zero Configuration Option</h3>
                <p>
                  One of the best ways to show off Vue is just to dive right in and show off Vue. So first, let's start
                  off by installing one of the Vue packages here. It's called Vue CLI, that's the CLI itself, and we're
                  going to do that globally, so I'm going to use the -g flag. We're also going to install a second
                  global package here, and that's under the Vue scope, and it's going to be the cli-service-global, like
                  this. Now you really only need the Vue CLI to do most of what you want, but the cli-service-global is
                  going to allow us to do something special, which we call the zero configuration option. Let's take a
                  look at that. So notice I created a folder called play, and then vue inside of that. Now just to make
                  this easy, we're going to echo out a new file. Now in Vue, all of our templates go inside of a
                  template tag, so let's create one in here with an h1, that's going to be our HTML, it's going to say
                  Hello Vue CLI, and then we'll end our template like this. And the idea here is that we're going to
                  echo this out and send it right to a file called App. vue, and that should create that file for us. So
                  now if we do ls and we do App. vue, it's right there. We could also cat it, and it shows the contents.
                  Now that we have our single file, we can actually just say vue serve -o, for open, and this is
                  actually going to compile our Vue application and launch it in the browser, which you can see over
                  here on the right. This is the zero configuration option of the Vue CLI. And while you're not going to
                  build a fully fledged application with this, what's nice about this is you can take some simple ideas
                  and just try them out without having to create an entire file structure, or webpack, or a bunch of
                  other things that you may not need. Let's say that we wanted to use an editor to change our files.
                  I'll open up a separate terminal here, and I'll open this folder with VS Code, right here in the
                  bottom left, and I'll make the terminal take up a little less room. And we can see that here we've got
                  our App. vue file, and if I change this from Hello Vue CLI to Hello World, as soon as I save this
                  file, we should notice a change over here on the right-hand side because Vue is constantly looking at
                  this and serving the changes for us. And it's that easy to create a new file and then try out your
                  ideas with Vue.
                </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Why You Should Use the Vue CLI</h3>
                <p>Now that we've taken the Vue CLI for a test drive, let's take a moment to step back and think about
                  why you might want to use the Vue CLI in the first place. But first of all, CLI, what's that mean? It
                  means command line interface. So we're going to be typing in at the terminal. It allows us to create
                  things rapidly so you can have a really quick development experience, not just writing code, but
                  seeing the code. We can select different libraries that we want to use, and the Vue CLI will help
                  configure them for us. One of the best features is creating the build. It can optimize the builds for
                  loading speed. And depending upon how we like to write our code, and the different things we want to
                  do with writing our code, we can choose our own adventure. Choosing things like TypeScript or
                  JavaScript, or using Sass or ESLint. Now you might be wondering what makes building a new app so
                  difficult? Well, when you're starting from scratch, you often have a blank slate. Where do you start?
                  How do you organize the project structure? Do you have a style guide that you want to follow, and how
                  do you do that once you find one, like looking at the Vue documentation? How do you create that
                  optimized build, or any build at all, from scratch? How do you follow your team's conventions that you
                  might have specific for your team? How would you set up end-to-end or unit testing? And what about
                  plugins that you might want to add in, things like Vuetify for your UI, or Vuex for state management?
                  This is why using a tool like the Vue CLI is so helpful. It's got all these kinds of features, and
                  more, that are built into it. You want a PWA? It's there. You want to use Mocha or Jest? You got it.
                  Do you want TypeScript or do you want JavaScript? Do you want Babel? No worries. All these different
                  options come out of the box. You get to configure what you want. The bottom line is that the Vue CLI
                  makes it easy for you to create these applications. And that's why I recommend using the Vue CLI for
                  all applications that you start with Vue. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>A Sneak Peek at the Vue CLI</h3>
                <p>Now let's take a sneak peek at the Vue CLI. The first thing we'll look at is how we can create a new
                  application. We've seen how we can install the CLI using npm here, and then afterwards we can do a vue
                  create, and then we name the project, in this case, hello-vue, and we can specify different flags and
                  options here. The -d means use all the defaults. We'll learn more about that in a later module. So in
                  a typical workflow, what you might do is vue create hello-world, the name of your project, and then cd
                  into that project, and then run your project right out of the gate with npm run serve. This is because
                  the Vue CLI gives you an npm script called npm serve, which you can then run to basically build your
                  application and then serve it in a browser. And that will watch the file, so if you make changes, it
                  will automatically rebuild it and then show it again in the browser. Here's some other commands that
                  we're going to use and get familiar with with the Vue CLI. First, vue create. We're going to use that
                  a lot. That's to create a new Vue app. Vue --help will show you all the commands that the Vue CLI
                  offers. We can use --help with subcommands like vue create. So we could do a vue create --help to see
                  what the create offers. When the Vue CLI creates our application, it adds three scripts by default to
                  our package. json. Those are for linting, building, and serving. And as you might have guessed, we
                  then can lint our build or server application using those scripts. But what if you don't want to type
                  into the terminal using the CLI, it is a command line interface, after all? Well, the Vue CLI comes
                  with a UI. That's right. So we have a visual way to create or configure our application. We can use
                  the commands here in the window to do that. We can add plugins or just look at the plugins that are in
                  our project. And of course, we can do things like build and lint and serve. The Vue CLI's UI looks
                  something like this, and it's ever-evolving, but we can serve, build or lint, or even inspect the
                  webpack configuration right from here. And it gives us a lot of tools like starting and stopping our
                  server, analyzing what's in our bundles, and just a whole bunch of great goodness, which we can use.
                  Now that we have an idea for what the Vue CLI and the UI can do for us, let's dive right in and take a
                  tour of these features for ourselves. </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Test Drive the Vue CLI</h3>
                <p>The first thing we'll do is make sure we install the Vue CLI globally. Now we've already done that
                  here, but we can check to make sure it's installed by doing vue --version. Here I can see I'm using 3.
                  2. 1. For you, it'll be whatever version you've installed recently. Next, let's create a new project.
                  We'll do vue create and we'll call this hello-world. Now when we set up this, we're going to get asked
                  a bunch of options. We're going to choose the default, and I can use the down arrows to get to there,
                  and then hit the Enter key. And then it's going to go out and install all the default options that you
                  get with a Vue project. Once installed, there's a couple hints down here for us. For example, we can
                  cd into hello-world, and we can run npm run serve. But instead, I'm going to open up my favorite code
                  editor, Visual Studio Code, and we'll open it up here on the left-hand side in the bottom. Now we can
                  see we have a bunch of different files in there. The one we're going to look for is under src, and
                  then components, and then HelloWorld. So here we can see our hello-world app, and then back up here in
                  the terminal, we'll run npm run serve. That'll build the application in memory, and then it tells us
                  we can then browse to it at localhost:8080. So let's do that now. Here we can see the sample
                  application. Now notice it's running right now and showing it over here in the browser. If you wanted
                  to change some of this, which one of the easiest things we can do is just remove some of the stuff
                  that's on the page. For example, let's say we didn't want all this here for a guide, we could delete
                  that. And now you can see it rebuilds it and it deleted text on the right. We can get rid of these
                  essential links and CLI plugins, and as we keep deleting, you're going to see it rebuilding each time,
                  and then displaying it on the right-hand side. And there we go. So now we just have simply the logo
                  and then the Welcome to Your Vue. js App. Well this is great because it gives us that awesome edit,
                  and then build, and then looking at our application experience. So, this hot reload option is really
                  nice. Well let's Ctrl+C out of this, and now let's look at some of the other commands we can run, like
                  npm run lint. This will lint our application. In this case, there were no errors found, but if there
                  were it would report what those errors are. And by default, we're using ESLint in any configuration we
                  want, and of course we can customize that ourselves. When it's time to go ahead and build our
                  application so we can put it on a web server somewhere, we can run npm run build. And by default, it's
                  going to do a production build. Now the keyword here is production. Production means that it's going
                  to optimize the build for our production server. So you'll notice we have a couple files up there, and
                  you can see the size and the gzip size, and they are located in the dist folder. So, let's say we go
                  over to the dist folder for a moment and we can look at those. There's the same files that were
                  reported. Now we could serve those files with any server. Just to test it out, we're going to use a
                  quick server called http-server, using a tool from npm called npx. So we'll say npx run http-server on
                  the current folder. Now notice it's running this port on port 8080, the same one we had over here, so
                  we should be able to then just hit refresh, and there's our page. Now, we did all this from the
                  terminal, but we could also use tooling, like the Vue CLI UI. Let's take a look at that next. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Test Drive the Vue CLI UI</h3>
                <p>Another powerful option with the Vue CLI is to type vue ui where we get a graphical user interface to
                  interact with the Vue CLI. So here we can see it launches on port 8000, and it shows us the projects
                  that we have. We can create new ones or import existing ones. So here we can go ahead and put in
                  import, and we can see that this is in the hello-world folder. We can then import that folder and here
                  is our project. Let's make this full screen and take a look at what we get. Notice we can kill a port.
                  We got our new project here and it kind of gives a quick whirlwind of what's going on. I can say yes,
                  I understand this. And then we can look to these different options like installed plugins. We have
                  vue/cli-service, and Babel, and ESLint out of the box. We got those because we chose the default
                  options. And then up top it's giving us the option to add popular ones like the vue-router and vuex.
                  These are additional plugins we can put into our project. Looking over our project dependencies, we
                  can see all the dependencies in our project as well, and the version numbers of those, and we can
                  install new ones or we can delete existing ones. Next, we can look at the configuration. By default,
                  we have two right here. The first one is the Vue CLI's configuration, like where is our code actually
                  going to get billed to, dist. And we can change that if we want to. And we can scroll through these
                  different options to look at how we want it to work. Now we also have another configuration for
                  ESLint. Now here we can see that we're doing Lint on save, and then our configuration is the default
                  one. We can change that if we want. And we can also go define the rules that we have. And again, by
                  default, we're just using the default setting, so we didn't do any of those. And finally, we can look
                  at tasks. Here's where we can serve our application. Let's click on that right now and see what we
                  get. We've got our dashboard here. We've also got our output, which shows us what's happening while it
                  serves, and then we can click on our analyzer, which shows us what's in the served output. So here,
                  let's click on running the task, and while it's happening we can click on the output to see what's
                  going on. Notice here it shows us the build and it says it's running on port 8080. Let's go ahead and
                  click on that. It opens up over here, there's our application. And then we can click on our dashboard.
                  Notice it shows it's been idle. Here's our dependencies and modules and assets. And then our analyzer
                  can analyze our application. This is really powerful because we can now look at what's inside of our
                  bundles. And then when we're ready, we can stop the task. We can also go back over to our tasks here,
                  and we see we got a build task, we can build our application, we can lint from right here. If these
                  are familiar, that's because we can run these same commands right from the CLI itself from the
                  terminal. We can also inspect the webpack configuration if we want to. This is just a really quick
                  glimpse at what we can do with the Vue CLI's UI. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Summary and Next Steps</h3>
                <p>In this module, you got a quick tour of the Vue CLI and all the main features that it has, really
                  just to give you a taste of the things that you can do, but yeah, there's so much more. You installed
                  the Vue CLI and verified it by checking the version. You created your first new application, Hello
                  World. We're going to create a lot more applications throughout this course using the Vue CLI. You
                  linted your code, you built your application for production, and you served your first app. Then we
                  also took a quick look together at how we can edit our files and then use hot reloading when we run
                  that npm run serve command, so all of our changes are shown in a browser right away. That makes for a
                  really great development experience. And finally, we took a look at the Vue CLI's UI, so we can run
                  the same commands that we do in the terminal over in the UI. And really, you might want to choose one
                  or the other based upon what you're trying to accomplish, and we'll learn more about that throughout
                  the course. And now that your quick tour of the Vue CLI is over, it's time to learn all of these
                  details and so much more. </p></div>

                  Before we kick it into high gear, it's important to know how to set up the Vue CLI so you can be set
                  up for success. So in this module, we'll talk about what you need to set up the Vue CLI, which of
                  course includes installing the prerequisites. We'll go through what those are and then we'll check how
                  you can make sure that you installed the right versions, which is also important in case new versions
                  come out so you can make sure you know how to look at those versions to then update them to the latest
                  versions. Once we verify the versions, we'll then check out if the setup actually works for us, and
                  we'll do that by creating a Vue application. We'll do this twice actually in a couple different ways
                  just so we can make sure everything is working properly. Once we do that, we can have high confidence
                  that we are ready to roll.
                </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Installing the Vue CLI</h3>
                <p>The first step with installing the CLI is of course to make sure you have the prerequisites. Here
                  we're going to use Node, and you'll go to the nodejs. org URL to get this. I recommend downloading the
                  LTS version for your particular operating system. LTS stands for long-term support. And then once you
                  get that, you can then install Node locally on your machine. Next, we want to install the Vue CLI
                  itself, so we'll do that by doing npm install, -g for global, and then @vue/cli. @Vue is the scope for
                  the view packages. This will put the package globally on our machine using npm. If you happen to roll
                  with Yarn, you could use Yarn to do the same thing by doing yarn global add @vue/cli. Now depending
                  upon your network connection to npm and the world, this may take a few seconds or up to a minute. Once
                  you get that, I highly recommend you verify your installation works. There's a couple things you can
                  do. The most simplest is to do vue --version. This will tell you the version of the CLI that you just
                  installed. When I recorded this course, it was 3. 2. 1. Now the version is important, but also
                  obviously if I can do vue --version, that means that the Vue CLI is there. Make sure that you've got
                  the latest version of the CLI, and you can check the Vue docs to look at that. Then check the version
                  of Node, make sure that we installed the version that you thought you installed by doing node
                  --version. The current minimum at the time of recording this course is 8. 9, but you'll always want to
                  check the Vue docs for updated information. You can find that link right here. And finally, I like to
                  just make sure that I've got a version of npm that I'm aware of, and currently that is 6. 4. 1. When
                  you get Node by default, it brings npm with you for now. That could change in the future, you never
                  know. If you're using Yarn, make sure you've got the most recent version of Yarn as well. Well now
                  it's time to actually walk through and install and verify those same things. Let's do this
                  together. </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Install and Verify</h3>
                <p>
                  Before getting started in installing, I've mentioned the Vue CLI docs a few times. So let's go to that
                  page and make sure we know what we're installing because we always want to check to see what the
                  latest versions are. So here I go to cli. vuejs. org and there's a big button down here called Get
                  Started. When I click on that, we're brought right to the overview. We want to go to Installation,
                  which we'll click on here in the left, and the first thing is a nice warning that we should make sure
                  we're using the proper version of CLI. The Vue CLI 3, version 3, was refactored and renamed using the
                  scoping, and that's what we're using here in this course. So moving forward, all the versions of the
                  CLI will be @vue/cli. So make sure that's the one you're installing. It also mentions here the Node
                  version requirement. I imagine as this evolves this will also be updated, so always check here to make
                  sure you have the proper version of Node. Then below we see how we can install with npm and Yarn and
                  then check the version. Now let's go take a look at Node. We could click on this button here or I've
                  already got it opened. This is the main page of Node, and we can see that it recognizes I'm using a
                  Mac, and I'm going to click on the LTS button here to download that version. Once it downloads that, I
                  can then double-click it and then install Node on my machine and follow the prompts that it gives you.
                  Once installed, we can flip over to a terminal and we can run commands like node --version. We can see
                  the version there. And we can also check out our npm version. Now both of these also support -v to
                  just check the version as well. Next, we want to install the Vue CLI. Here's where we type in npm
                  install, or just i if we want to, I'll type the full thing out, -g for global, and then @vue/cli. And
                  then we'll install the Vue CLI together. Once installed, we'll type in vue --version, and there we go.
                  And that's all you need to do to make sure the CLI is installed along with Node as its prerequisite.
                </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Creating Apps with the Vue CLI</h3>
                <p>Before we can confidently say that we've got the Vue CLI set up correctly, we want to make sure we
                  can create an application and it works. So let's do this together. What we're going to do is create
                  and serve an app. So we'll run the vue create command, specify the name to be hello-cli, and then use
                  the default options, so we just avoid the prompts for now that the CLI would give us and give us a
                  default application. We're just testing this out. We'll change the directory to go to the new folder
                  we created, and then we'll run npm run serve, and then browse to the location where it opens our
                  application inside of our browser. Once we do this for the CLI, we'll also use the Vue CLI's UI to do
                  the same thing to make sure both of them work properly. Now grab your keyboards and let's try this out
                  together. Inside of a terminal, we can then check to make sure we have the right version of Vue. I
                  like to do that just to make sure I've got it installed here. We'll type in vue create hello-cli, like
                  this, and I'll put the -d on there for the default options. Once the CLI is completed, it gives us the
                  instructions at the bottom and tells us to go into the hello-cli folder, we'll do that now, then type
                  npm run serve. Once we do that, it builds the application, and it then will tell us where to launch
                  the browser, right here at localhost 8080, and then I'll open that up inside my browser and here is
                  our application. Perfect. Next, I'm going to cancel out of here and we're going to back out to a new
                  folder again, and this time I'm going to create a different project. And to do that I'm going to type
                  vue ui. So now it's going to start the GUI for the Vue CLI right here in the browser, and notice
                  hello-cli if I come back to it and I refresh, it's not running anymore, so I'll close that. And let's
                  go full screen. Then I'm going to click on the Home button in the bottom left. Now here we can see we
                  already had one called hello-world. You may have others on your machine as well. I'm going to click
                  Create up here in the middle. It's then asking where do you want to create this. I don't want to
                  create it in hello-world, I want to create it inside my play vue folder. So I'll click on that folder.
                  Now I'm going to click on Create a new project here. We want to type the name of the project. In this
                  case we're going to type hello-cli-ui, and then we're going to keep all the defaults and click on
                  Next. Notice now we can start selecting our options. We're going to choose Default again, which is
                  basically the same as doing the -d flag like we did from the terminal. Now we're clicking on Create
                  Project. Once the project has been completely installed, we can now see a Welcome page, and it tells
                  us over on the left there's additional things that we can do. We'll run over to the Tasks right here
                  in this icon, and then we can click on serve, and we'll just click on the defaults for running it, and
                  it's going to run this serve task, same thing as when we do npm run serve in the command line. We can
                  also click on the Open app button over here once it's done. We know it's done because it's been idle
                  for 2 seconds and it's running and everything is green, and there is our default app. And now we have
                  a high level of confidence that we can create Vue apps from the CLI and the CLI's UI. </p></div>

                <h3>Summary and Next Steps</h3>
                <p>
                  Congratulations, you just verified and set up the Vue CLI. Now you're ready to roll. To recap, we
                  installed Node. js, our prerequisite for running the Vue CLI. Then installed the Vue CLI either using
                  npm or Yarn, and then we verified our setup and of course created our first two apps, hello-cli and
                  hello-cli-ui. And this module was left intentionally short so we can show how simple it is to install
                  the different tools that we need to run the Vue CLI. In the next module, we'll take a look at some
                  other development tools that we can use to enhance the Vue development experience along with the Vue
                  CLI.

              Tools</h2>

                <h3>Using Great Tooling for Vue</h3>
                <p>One of the best positive influences that we can have in our development experiences is using great
                  tooling, and that applies to Vue developers as well. In this module, we're going to talk about the
                  essential Vue tools that are going to help you become a great Vue developer. We'll start off by
                  talking about the single most impactful tool that you can have in your toolbox, and of course that is
                  the Vue CLI, and sometimes when you're just not sure how to solve a problem, don't worry, there's some
                  great Vue documentation for various libraries up there, and we'll take a look at some of those so you
                  know how to find them. We live in the browser, so it's important to know how to use the browser
                  tooling. We'll look at some plugins that you can use inside the browser and how we can do debugging in
                  the browser for our Vue applications. Now when it comes time to open up our editor, we'll take a look
                  at some great tools, things like code snippets and a great extension called Vetur, which helps us with
                  writing Vue applications inside of tools like Visual Studio Code. This entire module is very demo
                  driven, so let's go ahead and dive into all the Vue tooling that you need to have in your
                  toolbox. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Vue CLI Overview</h3>
                <p>
                  Let's get familiar with a couple of the most important Vue CLI commands. Now first we're going to run
                  vue --help. Help is super important because when we're not sure what to do, it gives us a little bit
                  of a hint. So here we can do vue help and it shows us how we can see the version or we can see the
                  commands like create or add a plugin or inspect the options or do a build or invoke the UI. We can
                  also do these subcommands like help on things like create. So for example, I could do vue create
                  --help, and here you'll see all the different options that we have for creating a new Vue project. For
                  example, we could create a project like this and say vue create, and we'll just call it foo for a
                  moment, we're not actually going to create it, with a default flag, but we can add a second flag.
                  Let's say we wanted to create a bare project, which is -b, and we can put those two letters together
                  like -db, and the order's not important. And this designates that we're going to have default project
                  settings and we're going to have a scaffold of a bare project. Basically a project without the
                  beginner instructions. If you recall in the project that we created for hello-cli, it had a hello
                  world component and it hooked it up with a bunch of links to documentation and things. Well, we don't
                  want to do that for every project, we can just go ahead and use the bare setting. So we can combine
                  several of these letters if we want to. Let's just go back to vue help here and maybe we wanted to
                  know how vue add works. So we could do vue add --help like this, and now we can see the usage of vue
                  add. So we can type vue add and then the options that we might want to use. In this case there were
                  very few, like where is the npm registry if we are using a different one than the default, and we can
                  specify the name of a plugin. For example, maybe Vuex or the Vue router. There's a couple other
                  commands that we're going to get familiar with, and one of those, if we're inside of a project, we can
                  do cat on a package. json, which'll just show us everything inside the packet. Doing a quick glance,
                  you can do that here and see the scripts right up there. We can see all the npm scripts, serve, build,
                  and lint. Let's open our favorite editor code. You can type code and then dot. I have a shortcut in my
                  machine to type c, and then we'll open up the window here to see different files. We can click on
                  package. json or we can find the package. json up top. And now we can see the scripts. There's serve,
                  build, and lint. Now these are shortcuts to be able to run the serve, build, and lint commands that
                  the Vue CLI exposes. Serving will compile the application in memory and then launch it so we can then
                  view it in a browser. Build will build the optimized version of the build for production by default.
                  And lint will lint our entire application. Let's go back to terminal for a moment, and we'll type vue
                  help one more time. Notice what is missing in here. Notice that there's a create for creating a
                  project, but there is no generation command. So for creating new components or new files, we just
                  create those with our favorite editor. Now I personally don't think that that's a gap in the CLI, it's
                  just that pretty much all you're going to do is create a component or just a plain old JavaScript file
                  and start writing your code. If you need some extra help with some of the syntax, there are ways to do
                  that, and we'll learn about those later in this module.
                </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Navigating the Vue Documentation</h3>
                <p>
                  The next stop on our tour of essential tools is to look at the documentation that you're going to want
                  to know how to get to and how to explore. First place, of course, is the vuejs. org home page. Let's
                  take a look at the Learn button at the top, and we can see there's a Guide, an API, Style Guide,
                  Examples, and Cookbook. The Guide is effectively the docs. It's the ideal place to ask questions and
                  get them answered for how does the v-for work with loops? Or v-if with conditionals? And you'll notice
                  that the table of contents is over here on the left. And then you've got the content here in the
                  middle. I recommend reading through here even if you feel that you know Vue strongly. There's a lot of
                  great information. The next stop would be the API. The API is ideal for learning things like how do I
                  know the API for props? So if we scroll down to Options/Data, props, which I'll give you a hint here,
                  you could actually just on the page do search with Cmd+F and you can find the word props, or you could
                  use the search up top here and it shows you all the places you can find props. In this case it just
                  found the guide. So I like to go to the page itself in the API and then just search for it, or you can
                  just scroll through the table of contents. Now notice here in props it's showing us the syntax. For
                  example, in props we can have this object where we've got height and then a number for the type check.
                  Or we could have a more complicated object like this with age. But it's great for looking up the
                  syntax and things inside the API. Next on our list is the Style Guide. It's currently in beta at the
                  time of recording this course. This is great though because it shows you different categories, and if
                  we scroll to the left we can see those. The first one's essential rules, strongly recommended rules,
                  and then recommended rules and use with caution rules. And then finally we've got Examples and
                  Cookbook. The Cookbook is ideal for showing us scenarios and solutions. So notice down here in the
                  left one of my favorites is Dockerizing your Vue App. First it talks about how you can use a
                  Dockerfile and create your Vue app, and notice it's launching it with the HTTP server. It also
                  explains why it made these decisions, and then how you can also use something like NGINX or Apache if
                  you want to use it in production. So these are the Vue docs. There's also a whole bunch of stuff in
                  the ecosystem. For example, of course, there's the Vue CLI. I'll hold Cmd down and open a new tab for
                  that. There's also the Vue Router and Vuex. Just a couple different things are there. The Vue CLI, we
                  can go over and look at its own docs. We can click on Get Started or just go right to the Guide. If
                  we're looking at the Vue Router, we can go click on its guide as well, which brought us right to it
                  here in this case, we learn how to use the Vue router, or Vuex for state management, and we can learn
                  how this all works. Just a recap, there's the main Vue docs, there's the Vue CLI docs, the Vue Router
                  docs, and then the Vuex docs, and many, many more. The best place to go if you're getting a little
                  confused is right to the main Vue docs, and then you can look for all the other docs right from its
                  main menu.

                <h3>Getting Familiar with the Vue Developer Tooling</h3>
                <p>
                  The next stop on our dev tools tour is to look at the tools for the browser that we can use to help us
                  debug and analyze Vue apps. The best place we can go for this is to open up a new tab. And then open
                  github. com/vuejs/vue-devtools. This is a repository holding the dev tools by the official Vue team.
                  We scroll down, we can see what those dev tools look like, and the features it offers, and notice
                  there's three different ways we can install it currently. One's a standalone Electron app, another
                  one's a Firefox add-on, and the third one's a Chrome extension. Let's click on the Chrome extension
                  just to see how we can get there. Notice I'm in the Chrome web store and then I could add it if I
                  didn't already have it with the button over here, and right now I could remove it. Once you have it in
                  your browser, you'll see a little icon like this up here. All right, so what does this offer for you?
                  To find out how we can use these tools, let's open another tab and let's type in jpapa. me/heroes-vue.
                  This'll bring you to my GitHub repository of an app called heroes-vue. It's called the Tour of Heroes,
                  and you can see it running right here in production mode if you'd like to do that. This is the Tour of
                  Heroes app written with Vue. Now we're going to pull this code down. So we're going to clone it by
                  clicking on the Clone button. I'm going to copy this here. You can also just download the zip if you'd
                  like to. We'll flip back over to our play folder. And now I'm going to type git clone or use
                  heroes-vue. git. And now once we get that, we're going to go into that folder and then run npm
                  install. Once you've cloned the repository, we're going to run npm run quick. This is an npm script
                  that I created that not only starts up the Vue application and serves it, but also starts up a back
                  end for us. This will run the application in development mode, and then we can click on the port to
                  run it locally. Notice we're running locally now. And here if I click on the button for the Vue tool,
                  you'll see that it detected Vue on the page. So now I can open up the development tools and I can go
                  over here and click on Vue, and you'll see that there's my elements for components, and all the
                  different ones are showing up here. Now let's go down into Heroes themselves and we'll click on the
                  HeroList. Notice in the HeroList I've got a CardContent, there is Aslaug the warrior queen, and you'll
                  see the props are down here. And when you click on the props, you'll have options like copying the
                  value. Now let's select Aslaug by doing Edit, and if I can't figure out where the element is here I'll
                  go over to the left and get it. The way I do that is to click on this little icon up here. That'll
                  select component in the page. And then I can select the name for Aslaug. And down here we can see
                  there's the Hero in the props. There's also data. Now with the data you can edit it. So let's say we
                  wanted to change the description from warrior queen, we could come over here and type something
                  different. We could type in here it's a vue hero, and then hit Cancel or Save and notice the value
                  changes here and over on the left. We can also look at the elements here, and then flip back if we
                  want to Vue. And the top, we can see there's different icons. This one is for the components, that's
                  what we're looking at now. The second icon is to show Vuex. If your application's using Vuex for state
                  management, which this one is, you'll see the Base State is here, we can pull that up a little bit,
                  and let's change Aslaug to joe. We'll scroll down, press Save, and you'll see the change was made
                  right here. Now we can see the full state. Notice there's 6 heroes and there are 0 villains at this
                  point. And we can open that up and look at them. And then we've got our getters, and then there's a
                  mutation that was just made. And we can click through here using time traveling. Now, why aren't there
                  any villains? Because I haven't clicked on villains yet, so now when I go get the villains you'll see
                  the villains appear. So this tool is great for showing this, and then we can stop recording or we can
                  clear the state out. The third option is to show the events. The events are nice because it shows you
                  all the events that have happened. Let's clear this out. And now when I click on Edit, we can see it
                  was selected on the villain list and then clicked on the button footer. I'm going to come down here
                  and hit Cancel. We'll get an unselect and a clicked event that were emitted. And then finally we've
                  got a refresh that we can do right here. The Vue developer tools are a great complement to using the
                  Vue CLI to help you analyze the applications that you're creating.

                <h3>Debugging Vue in the Browser</h3>
                <p>
                  One of the most essential tools for developing with any platform is a debugger, and Vue is no
                  exception. So let's run the heroes-vue app again using npm run quick. And then when it's done we'll
                  launch this in the browser. And we'll go full screen real quick, but let's say we wanted to walk
                  through this application here in a debugger. We'll open up the developer tools over here on the
                  right-hand side, and we'll click on Sources. Now we happen to know that there is a heroes and a
                  heroeslist and a heroesdetails component in our application. So here we can see with sources all the
                  files. Let's actually hide that navigator. And I'm going to right-click up here and choose Close all.
                  Now let's say we want to walk through the process of what happens when we edit a hero; notice joe over
                  here. So let's first go up and we'll happen to know it's in the hero-detail vue is where this happens.
                  That's where the save is pressed. So here in saveHero on line 72 I'll set a breakpoint. Now this is
                  going to emit a save event, and it's going to be caught by the heroes component. So I'll have to go
                  look for the heroes component. It's right there, heroes. vue. And we should look up where for where is
                  it getting mapped to for save? Right down here on line 85. We know that because the template up top is
                  listening on the heroDetail, right here, for save to call the save function here. So we've got our
                  breakpoint set up and we can see these if we pull up the bottom piece. We can now see our breakpoints
                  set to hero-detail. vue and heroes. vue. So let's go ahead and edit joe, and then we'll press Save
                  down here. Notice we can catch that in the debugger. It shows us the editing hero. We can see the
                  description, the ID, and the name. We can also break into this in the console, and we can type in any
                  of those values, so we could do this. editingHero, and we can see the whole object right there. And
                  then we can let it run through by clicking this button there to resume. And notice now here back in
                  the heroes component it's listening to that save event that was emitted from the hero details, now we
                  can walk through it line by line if we want, stepping over it. We can hover over this hero. id. Here's
                  the new hero right there. Now we can just press run, resume, and we're good to go. Now we can disable
                  our breakpoints, and if we go and edit again, we can put in here with an exclamation and do Save.
                  Nothing gets caught. There's nothing specific about Vue in this process. It's just walking through and
                  debugging JavaScript inside of the Chrome development tools. I find it very useful to be able to use
                  this as just another tool in my toolbox when using the Vue CLI to develop Vue applications.
                </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Developing with Vue in Visual Studio Code</h3>
                <p>There are some great editors out there that you can use. My favorite happens to be Visual Studio
                  Code. And you can grab that here from code. visualstudio. com. There's great support in VS Code for
                  using things like Vue. First you can download the version you like. I happen to like to use the
                  Insiders version. That's what I have installed here. The Stable you get once a month. The Insiders you
                  happen to get updates almost daily, sometimes more than once a day. This means that you're getting the
                  new features as soon as they're available. It's been extremely stable for me, so that's what I've been
                  using for the last several years. It only takes a moment to download. We'll do that right now. And
                  after you downloaded it, it brings you to a Getting Started page. Notice it's about 66 MB at the time
                  of recording. And there we go, it's installed. At that point you can then install it on your machine
                  by opening up the zip file. Now once we open code and we look at a project such as the HEROES-VUE
                  project, you'll notice that when we click on a Vue file, all the text is the same color. It's not
                  recognizing what a. vue file is. One of the great things about VS Code is you can extend it with
                  language services, in this case a Vue language service, and there's an extension for that. If we click
                  on the extensions icon on the left, and then go search for it, they call it Vetur, right there, by
                  Pine Wu, we can then install this and then we'll reload. And now let's go back and look at that same
                  file called heroes. vue. Notice we get all the syntax coloring and highlighting that we need. There's
                  a whole lot more inside of Vetur that we get. Let's take a quick look at that by opening up the
                  extension, and now we'll type Vetur again. This time it finds one that we have. Let's go check out the
                  docs. There's a lot of things that you get out of the box, like syntax-highlighting, you get a couple
                  snippets, linting and error checking, formatting. For formatting it uses Prettier if you've got the
                  prettierrc file inside of your project, which I happen to have inside the vue-heroes project. You get
                  IntelliSense inside the template, style, and script tags for the single file component in Vue. There's
                  a recipe right here for debugging inside of Visual Studio Code. And there's a whole lot more on there
                  including a roadmap for future versions. Okay, so back inside of VS Code, let's go and look at a Vue
                  file real quick. I'm going to hit Cmd+B to hide the sidebar and Cmd+J to hide the bottom panel. Now
                  let's say that I had nothing in this file. I'm going to highlight everything and delete it. Maybe I
                  need to put in a brand new Vue file here. One of the snippets you get out of the box is called
                  scaffold, and it gives you the template, the script, and then the style tags. But I happen to like
                  another extension that's out there. Don't worry that this file's empty, we've got Git source control
                  here. You can always undo. If you go to the extensions there's another one. This time I'm going to
                  type in vue just to see what's out there. There's some Vue snippets right here from hollowtree, but
                  there's also some from sarah. drasner. I happen to like these ones here, so I'll install those. You
                  can really use any that you like of course. Once we have those snippets installed, now I can type
                  something called vbase, and notice on the right-hand side it's previewing what I'm going to get.
                  There's vbase. It's very similar to the other extension that we had. And let's say inside of here we
                  wanted to do something with data. I could type in vdata. And we get the data attribute right there. We
                  can type our key in and our value. Let's say we wanted a method. I can type in vmethod, and there we
                  go. If I wanted to do a computed, there's a vcomputed we can use. So some nice little snippets that we
                  can use inside of our code as we're generating the files. And of course, like any good editor, there's
                  always an undo with Git control. We can discard those changes, and we get our file back. There's a
                  whole lot of other extensions that you can install. One of my favorites, again, is Prettier that you
                  can use for formatting your code. And if you happen to like this theme, it's called Winter is Coming
                  and it's one that I created. You can download and install these for free right from VS Code. I realize
                  the editor is a very personal choice. I happen to really like this one because it makes my development
                  flow much easier. So that's the one I'll be using throughout this course. And if you'd like to use it,
                  these are some great tips that you can use to get going. </p>

                <h3>Debugging Vue in Visual Studio Code</h3>
                <p>
                  We know that we can debug inside of Chrome, but if we install the extension for Chrome debugging in VS
                  Code, we can do it right from VS Code. So here we can type in Chrome in the extensions marketplace.
                  Notice I've already got the debugger there. It's a little popular. It's got 15 million downloads. So
                  it's quite the well-used extension. Let's take a look at how we can set this up. First, inside of the
                  vue. config. js, notice I have from lines 2 through 4 configureWebpack and my devtool is set to
                  source-map. And then let's hit the Debug pane over here and hit the gear and choose Chrome. That's
                  going to set up a debug configuration for Chrome. Now we'll name this something that's a little more
                  useful like Vue with Chrome. And the name is just what's going to show up in the box in the upper
                  left. The URL is where you're launching from. Our app happens to launch from 9626. Because it's the
                  Tour of Heroes app it's heroes-vue. If you're using 8080 or 8000, make sure you adjust the port
                  accordingly. Our web root is where our source code is. Ours happens to be in workspaceFolder/src. I
                  like to set the setting called breakOnLoad. I set that to true. And if you'd like to know what these
                  things do, if you hover over them you get a little tooltip. And this is an experimental feature and it
                  says here of course that if it's true it's going to attempt to set a breakpoint before the scripts are
                  loaded. So it can hit anything at the beginning. And then there's a sourceMapPathOverride, which we're
                  going to set. And when you automatically type this it's going to fill in a bunch of these options for
                  us. Now it's okay to leave them all here, but the one we really need is right there. It's the second
                  one, so we could just run with this one here. Now once we have these, what do we accomplish? We set up
                  a launch configuration that allows us to set breakpoints and debug right here inside of VS Code. So
                  how does it work? Okay, once we do this, and this is a one-time thing, you save this for your project.
                  And again, we set the vue. config. js, and we set a launch. json file up, which is a VS Code feature.
                  When we have both of those and the Chrome debugging extension installed, all we have to do now is run
                  our app and set breakpoints. So let's close both these files. And let's go find our heroes. vue, and
                  we'll come down into the data. And I'll set a breakpoint right there on the return of data, and we'll
                  do another one on askToDelete. So when we click the button to delete, we should get a breakpoint
                  there. Next we run our app. In this case we can run it from terminal. I'm going to open up the
                  terminal right here inside of VS Code. It's integrated into it. Npm run quick will do it for me.
                  That'll build it, and then launch it when it's ready. Don't worry about that localhost 9627, that's
                  the back-end server. We're proxying our API calls to that. Our app is actually running on 9626 as we
                  can see here. Now no debugger happened yet. That's because we haven't launched it. If we go back over
                  here to the Debug window, and now we click on the go button, this green button up here, make sure that
                  Vue: Chrome is selected because you could have multiple configurations. Now we run it. It launches the
                  app in a browser and notice we hit our first breakpoint. Return on the data. Now I'm going to go ahead
                  and show this side by side, VS Code on the left, and we'll make it so we can see everything pretty
                  good, and the app on the right. It says it's paused in the VS Code. Now we can let it run.
                  Everything's good here unless we want to delete the second one. When I click Delete right here, it
                  goes over here and it prompts us for it. So let's go back to full screen on VS Code. We can hover over
                  hero and we can see the values. We can look over on the left at the Local window. Now we can see the
                  values there. We can edit them as well. We can change this to John if we want to right there. Probably
                  not a great idea, but we can do these things. And then we can step through one by one. Now it's going
                  to show the modal. And if I flip back over to the code, you can see that the code is still running on
                  this side, and I could let it rip. Just let it run. We're good. Now it's asking if I want to delete
                  it. I'll say no. This is how easy it is to debug projects that you create with the Vue CLI right from
                  VS Code using the Chrome debugger extension.
                </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Reviewing the Vue Tooling</h3>
                <p>In this module, we learned about all the tooling that we can use in conjunction with the Vue CLI. VS
                  Code is an important part of that, and that included extensions like Prettier, Code Snippets, and
                  Vetur. Of course, we need the Vue CLI and its UI to do the great tooling that it has for us to
                  generate our projects and do our builds and our runs, and we integrated it all by doing debugging both
                  through the Chrome browser and in VS Code using the Chrome debugging extension. And finally, don't
                  forget that one of the best tools we have is the great documentation that Vue provides for us. I'm a
                  firm believer of making sure before you start a project that you have all your tools laid out and a
                  good plan, and hopefully by going through this module you've got that plan for your Vue CLI, the
                  documentation, the browser tooling, debugging plans for yourselves both with the browser and VS Code,
                  and all the extensions that you need. And now we're set up to be successful using the Vue CLI to
                  create great Vue applications. </p></div>
            </div>
            <div><h2>Creating a Vue
              Application</h2>
              <div>
                <h3>Application Creation Concepts</h3>
                <p>As developers, when we start to build a new application, so many thoughts go through our heads when
                  we stare at that blank screen. What files am I going to create? What features do I need? Are there any
                  settings I want to have right out of the gate? What's the folder structure going to look like? Vue CLI
                  can help answer all of these for us, which is great. So in this module, we're going to walk through
                  creating a Vue application. Sometimes we need to get it started quickly, and we'll learn the options
                  that we can do to get out of the gate fast, and then we're going to look through all the different
                  creation options because there's so many creation options for creating a brand-new project. When we
                  walk through using the Vue CLI, it's going to ask us a lot of questions. These are called prompts.
                  We'll learn what these prompts are and how we can save and share and then reuse these favorite answers
                  of ours from the prompts. By the end of this module, you'll have mastered how to customize the Vue CLI
                  to generate new projects just the way you need them. </p></div>

                <h3>Learning the Application Creation Options</h3>
                <p>Learning the different options for creating Vue apps is an important part of using the Vue CLI. The
                  first step when using many of these commands is to look at the help flag. So we just type in vue
                  create --help, it will tell us all the many options that come with vue create and what the default
                  settings are and what they all do. When we generate a new Vue app, there's a couple commands that you
                  need to learn, the first to which is the vue create. So we can say vue create hello-vue, and if we do
                  this by default and hit Enter, we'll follow the prompts after this to create an application. We'll
                  learn more about those prompts in an upcoming section. We've seen a few times now we can do vue create
                  hello-vue, and then -d, or --default. This will use the default settings and create a Vue application.
                  Basically, it won't ask us any questions, it'll just create the app for us with some very intelligent
                  defaults. Another option we can do is vue create hello-vue -db. We're combining two different aliases
                  now for both defaults and creating a bare project. That's what the b stands for. What's a bare
                  project? This means instead of having the Vue app come up with a bunch of links and helpful quick
                  starts, none of those will be there because when you build an application, you're probably not going
                  to want all of those things on your page, but when you're first starting out, they're kind of helpful.
                  We just learned about an alias there for -d and for -b. So let's take a step back and learn what these
                  do. Two dashes prefix the options normally, so --default, just like this here, but we can also use a
                  single dash with d to alias as shortcut. In this case, -d stands for default. Notice here that the
                  first character of default is d, and that happens to be the alias. That's a convention when available,
                  but it isn't always the case because sometimes d can only be used once. Let's take a look at some of
                  these here. Here are some common vue create options. We learned about default, which is just -d. We
                  also saw a -b earlier where we can scaffold without the beginner instructions. That stands for bare.
                  Package manager is -m. This is do you want to use npm or Yarn at this time? Notice that the -m is not
                  the first letter of the option, which is p. This is what I meant earlier when it's not always the
                  first letter of the option. So, keep in mind the aliases are shortcuts, but if you forget those, you
                  can always do vue create --help to see them. If you want to change your registry, maybe you've got an
                  internal one you have to point to your own npm registry, you can use -r, or --registry. If you need to
                  use a proxy to be able to create your own app, you can use the --proxy, or an alias of -x. If you want
                  to skip to git initialization, which is on by default, you could go ahead and use -n or no-git. And
                  we're going to learn about presets in a later section of this module where we can skip a bunch of
                  prompts and basically use our saved customizations. That's --preset, or -p. Of course, don't forget
                  --help, which is almost always -h in most CLIs I've ever used. You may have been wondering about
                  earlier when we saw a -d and b together. Yes, we can combine some of these single character aliases.
                  We could do vue create hello vue -dbm yarn, right here, and what this means is we're going to use the
                  defaults, we're going to have a bare project, and we're going to use the Yarn package manager, so
                  we're combining those three together. This just makes it easy to use and we can set a bunch of options
                  as we see here. Now that we've learned about some of these options, let's go try them ourselves. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Creating a Default, Bare App with Yarn</h3>
                <p>Let's open up VS Code. I'm using the Insiders version. Now I'm going to hit Cmd+Shift+P, or it could
                  be Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows, then we're going to open up the integrated terminal, just like that. Now
                  notice that I'm inside of the folder called play/vue. You should be inside whatever folder that you're
                  creating these projects in. First we're going to type in vue --help. That's going to give us the help
                  commands for the Vue CLI itself. We see that create is in there, so we're going to do vue create
                  --help. Now we can see the different commands that we can use on vue create. We've used vue default
                  before right here, but let's try out the bare with default. So now we'll do vue create, and then
                  hello-vue-bare. We'll do d for default, b for bare, and let's also throw in the m for package manager
                  and we'll specify yarn. Now when I hit Enter, it's going to create this project. And notice it's using
                  yarn, right here, so yarn install, and it's going to go get all of the packages that we need and put
                  it on our machines. Perfect. Now we have hello vue bare, and it's giving us the commands to get in
                  there. We'll do hello like that. We're going to vue bare and change our directory. Now we can type
                  yarn serve, but here's a quick VS Code tip. When you're inside the integrated terminal, notice that my
                  folder on the left in the Explorer is the VUE folder. And now inside of terminal, I'm one level down.
                  If I want to make the Explorer show just hello-vue-bare, I could close VS Code and restart it, but
                  check out this tip. If you're using Code, just type code, if you're using Code Insiders, you type
                  code-insiders here. Say you want to open up which folder, the current one I'm in. I want to get to
                  hello-vue-bare, and then I'm going to do -r. Basically it's going to replace this running instance of
                  VS Code with one that'll have the folders in the left showing that folder I want. Now I hit Enter,
                  you'll see a flash of the screen, and now you can see that the folder I'm in is the vue bare project.
                  If we open up package. json, we can see the name right there on line 2. I'm going to open up the
                  terminal again, Cmd+Shift+P, view integrated terminal, and we're back in business. So what did the vue
                  bare project give us? If we scroll down a little bit and we come over to src, we'll see that we have a
                  single App. vue, which really just has the Vue logo and then an h1. If we went back and looked at the
                  project when we didn't run it with bare, we would see we have all these links and helpful tips to go
                  into the documentation. You'll also notice we do have yarn. lock files in here because we specified
                  Yarn as our package manager. And of course we've got the defaults because we used -d. So these are
                  just some other common options that you can use when creating quick projects with Vue. </p></div>

                <h3>Differences in the Vue CLI Creation Prompts</h3>
                <p>
                  Defaults are great, but most often you're going to want to set up your own customizations or use some
                  of the different prompts that the CLI offers you to create your own projects. This is why it's really
                  important to master the CLI prompts. I like to think about the prompts in three different ways. First,
                  we have the absence of prompts where we just use -d for our defaults. Second, we could also walk
                  through the prompts one by one and choose everything each time we create a project. And then third, we
                  can create a preset so we can skip the prompts and just go to our favorites. We've already tried
                  creating defaults, and before we can create presets, it's really important to understand what the
                  different prompts offer you. So let's go ahead and walk through a demo of all the different prompts so
                  we can understand what they do.
                </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Exploring the Application Creation Prompts</h3>
                <p>
                  Let's go back to VS Code in the integrated terminal, or you can choose your own separate terminal, and
                  I'm going to go back to my play/vue folder. I'm going to open back into the vue folder itself. We'll
                  type in vue create and we'll do prompts, like this. We're going to walk through the different prompts
                  here. The first prompt is a preset that I already created. You're probably not seeing that one. We'll
                  talk more about prompts shortly. The second one is choosing the defaults, and that we've already done
                  with the -d flag. Same thing here. And then the third option is to manually select our features. We're
                  going to select this one. Notice how I'm going up and down here too. I'm using the up and down arrows
                  to do this, and then I'll hit the Enter key to select it. Now we get a bunch of options that we can
                  choose. Two of them are on by default currently, Babel and the Linter/Formatter. Notice the hints on
                  how we can select them. We can do space to select, A to toggle them all, or I to invert a selection.
                  So we can do I here, and you'll notice they're inverting all of the selections. We can do A to select
                  them all, A again to deselect them, or we can walk through one by one. Let's choose everything. We can
                  do it one by one like this, or again we could choose A to unselect or A to get them all, because we're
                  just going to walk through what these different things mean. First, we chose that we wanted to use
                  TypeScript, and we're now getting asked a question about do we want to use class-style component
                  syntax, yes or no. Notice that Yes is uppercase and no is in lowercase. That means that Yes is the
                  default. If we just hit Enter, it will be Yes. Class-style component syntax means that we're going to
                  have a class for our components, and it's going to use this at component decorator for TypeScript.
                  We'll choose Yes for now. Should we use Babel alongside TypeScript for auto-detecting polyfills? This
                  is a good idea to make sure if we have to support older browsers, so we'll select Yes. Next, it's
                  asking about the router. Because we selected the router, we're being asked about the history mode.
                  Generally, a good idea these days is to use history mode, so capital Yes here. What does this mean?
                  This means that if we don't select this, we're going to have to use hash routing, and hash routing
                  will allow us to use client-side routing on any server, but that's going to put the little hash in all
                  of our URLs. We don't want that. We want normal URLs without the hashes, so we're going to use history
                  mode. Then we can choose our CSS preprocessor. This could be Sass, Less, or Stylus. We'll choose Sass.
                  Next, we get to choose our linter or formatter, or a combination thereof. Because we're using
                  TypeScript, we could choose TSLint. My favorite when I'm not using TypeScript is just ESLint with
                  Prettier. You could choose whichever you like. And then next, it's asking about how to fix things when
                  we're linting. I like to lint on save. That way when I save my files, it'll automatically check them.
                  I happen to use auto save in VS Code, which I can show you up here. In the menu, you go to File, Auto
                  Save is automatically checked for me, it may not be for you. That means any time I make a change in a
                  file, it's going to save the code and it'll automatically lint it. If auto save is not on for your
                  editor, it'll only lint when you press Save. If you don't want it to be that frequent, you could do
                  lint and fix on commits. Next, we pick our unit testing solution. That could be Mocha and Chai or
                  Jest. You pick your choice. And then we can choose our end-to-end testing framework, Cypress or
                  Nightwatch currently. I like Cypress, so that's the one I'm going to choose. Here's one that a lot of
                  people have a strong opinion on, and I'm one of those people. I like to have all of my configs for all
                  these different things in dedicated config files as opposed to putting them all in a single file
                  inside package. json. If we choose the dedicated config files, we'll have a separate file for ESLint
                  and for Babel and for everything that we used for configuration. It's more files in the root, but it's
                  much more conventional too. And then finally when you're done making your selections, it'll ask if you
                  want to create a preset. No is a default here. We're not going to do it for this one, but you can
                  absolutely choose a preset and then save it and then reload that later. We'll be seeing that in an
                  upcoming section here in this module. Now to get out of the CLI, because we just wanted to walk
                  through these, I'm going to hit Ctrl+C and it's going to cancel it. Sometimes you have to Ctrl+C
                  twice. Here we've seen all the different prompts that we can use. Now notice if I go back and do a
                  project called vue create prompts, and this time I do manually select and I only select let's say
                  Babel and the linter, now we're skipping all the other questions that don't apply. There's no more
                  TypeScript questions, for example, or unit testing questions. And again, you can just cancel out of
                  here, and that's all you need to know about going to the prompts.
                </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Understanding the Vue CLI Presets</h3>
                <p>
                  In this section, let's learn about how we can create and share and load Vue CLI presets, because
                  effectively if we're creating the same projects all the time with the same kinds of settings, we
                  should be able to do that without answering all these prompts all the time. So the presets are really
                  a lifesaver. They help us save those preferences, your preferences, for creating new Vue projects.
                  Let's see how we do this. To create a preset, first we go through the prompts. We might use prompts
                  like this where we pick a preset and we say nope, we're going to do manual features, you might choose
                  Babel on the linter, we choose all the options that we want, and when we're done, it's going to ask us
                  if we want to save this as a preset. So at that point, we can save the preset by putting a y in here
                  for yes, and then we'll name that preset. Now by default when you save a preset, it stores it in your.
                  vuerc file. This dot file is in your home folder on your computer. Now that doesn't really help you
                  for sharing it though, so you can go find those settings there. Another option is you can create your
                  own preset. json file and just point the CLI to it. And then a great option for sharing is put it up
                  in a repository like GitHub or Bitbucket so you can save it to preset. json in a repository and use
                  that. Great. So once we have the presets, how do we use them? Well, for in our. vuerc, we'll
                  automatically get prompted for them. That's how we saw the all JavaScript one earlier that I created,
                  but what if it's up in GitHub or in a local file? Well, we can point to those too. We'd say vue
                  create, and then the name of your project, hello, --preset, and in this case I'm assuming GitHub. I'm
                  saying johnpapa/, and then the name of our repository. So that repository is up in GitHub and it's
                  going to go look in there for a file called preset. json. You can also look at your local file. So we
                  could do vue create hello --preset, and then point to whatever path your preset. json file happens to
                  be located in. We can customize presets to include any options that are available in the CLI, and we
                  can extend them with plugins that support things like prompts. Let's walk through how we can save,
                  share, and load from different presets.
                </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Creating a Preset</h3>
                <p>Let's walk through creating our own preset. We'll type in vue create, and we'll just call this one
                  all because that's what we're going to select in this preset. We're going to walk through some prompts
                  here. We'll choose Manually select all features, and then we're going to choose everything. We can hit
                  A here to select them all, and we're going to un-select TypeScript. We're just going to do everything
                  that happens to be JavaScript just for now just to show how we can do this. So we're going to walk
                  through our different selections here. I'm going to choose Enter, Enter, Enter, Enter, Enter, Enter,
                  Enter. Just go through all of these options here and we're just going to try this out. Then we can
                  choose to select a preset. I'm going to say Yes in this case, and then give it a name like all
                  JavaScript. Now I already made one of my own, which you probably saw as I typed it right up here at
                  the beginning, preset for all options JavaScript. So once you save yours, you'll see it in your list
                  when you run the command again, so go ahead and try that. But where does that get saved? Well it's
                  being stored in a. vuerc file, so here's another trick. To load this file inside the editor, I'm going
                  to type code-insiders, or you can use code if that's what you're using as your editor, and I'm going
                  to open up that file. Mine happens to be in my home folder on my Mac. Like this, it'll be in your home
                  folder on Windows if you're using that as well. And then to make sure it loads inside of this instance
                  of VS Code, I'm going to use -r right up there. It's going to load. Now you'll see that that's what
                  the options look like. Notice the name I gave it. It's up here, All options JavaScript. Your name
                  should appear there as well. Then I've got all of my plugins and other options that I happen to set in
                  my preset. You might be wondering why it's all the same color, I'm not getting any IntelliSense here.
                  If I highlight everything and I de-indent it there, if that's a word, and then I format, nothing's
                  really working here. In fact, the editor tells me I don't know what kind of file this is. It's a.
                  vuerc. We can't expect the editor to know everything, right? So here's a neat thing you can try inside
                  of VS Code. If you go to Cmd+Shift+P, or Ctrl+Shift+P, the Command palette, and you type in settings
                  up top, we're going to go to the Preferences, User settings. Now up here we're going to type in file
                  associations, or part of the word like this. And then we can select Files: Associations here in the
                  JSON settings. Now at the bottom of this file, I'm just going to type in file. associations, like
                  this, and then I'm going to tell it, look, when you see a. vuerc file that happens to be JSON format,
                  like this, and make sure you save that file if you don't have auto save on. Now when I go back to my.
                  vuerc, notice I'm getting color coding because it knows it's JSON, and if I format this document,
                  which I can do through Cmd+Shift+P again or Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows, now I can format that. So here we
                  can see where we can find our. vuerc file and look at the formatting for the presets and how we can
                  edit it right here inside of VS Code. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Creating an App from a Preset</h3>
                <p>If you want to create a file that you can use or give to a friend so they can use your presets, you
                  can do that too. To do that, let's grab just the preset information. We don't need all the JSON from.
                  vuerc file. We could type this from here if we wanted to, but just to make this easier to see, I'll
                  collapse the plugins. Let me grab everything that's inside of these curly braces right there. I'll
                  create a new file, and then you'll see here I've got some JSON, which basically includes all the
                  settings that we want for our preset. I'm going to save this file. We're going to call it preset. json
                  and I'm going to put it inside my play/vue folder. And there we go. Then I can format the file and it
                  should be good to go. Make sure you got all the JSON right. Now once I have that file and I have these
                  different options in there, whatever those presets are, we can automatically use those to create a
                  project, and of course you can edit this if you want to. For example, we can say you know what, we
                  don't really want Vuex in this particular case. So now I could say inside of my vue folder, vue create
                  --preset, and then I can point to this file. Now if you named it preset. json, all you have to do is
                  point to the folder that it's in, and I'm in the same folder where preset. json is so I just can say.
                  /. If it was another folder, I could say other/folder, wherever it happens to be. And then I can name
                  my app, so I'm just going to call it my-app, and then when I run through this, it's going to generate
                  an app using the presets that I have right here. Perfect. Once that's done, we now have a project,
                  which we can get into called my-app, and we can see all the files that happen to be in there. This is
                  how you can create a local file for preset. json. </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Sharing and Using Remote Presets</h3>
                <p>
                  A lot of us work on teams, large and small. When I work on teams, what I like is to have consistent
                  conventions. So for my presets, I like to put them up in GitHub. You'll see one here at this GitHub
                  repository at johnpapa/vue-cli-preset-all-javascript, and you can see inside the preset. json file,
                  those are the presets I use when I want to use all the JavaScript options. Then from the ReadMe, you
                  can see the command that we can use to run that. Let's copy that for a moment. And we'll flip back to
                  VS Code. Inside of our vue folder, we'll paste that. Before we run it, we'll give it a different
                  project name. So we're saying vue create, use the preset located at GitHub, johnpapa/, and then the
                  URL name, and then we'll give it a new and unique name. You pick whatever you want. Now when we enter
                  that, it's going to run through the preset up in the GitHub repository, and then it's going to run
                  through what all those presets happen to need. Now while it's doing that, another option we could do,
                  we'll flip back over to the GitHub repository, is notice inside the preset, I've got the eslint plugin
                  here on line 6 set to use Prettier and lintOn save. What if we wanted to use this eslint plugin, but
                  instead of defining we want Prettier and lintOn save, we want to ask the user with a prompt. Instead
                  we could replace lines 7 and 8 with prompts true, so we just change that JSON here and that could
                  prompt just that one part. Now the plugin that you're using has to support those prompts for this to
                  work. And you can learn more about this more advanced option in the docs of the Vue CLI. So if we flip
                  back over to our project that we just created, we can see we successfully created vue-hello-js. That's
                  what I called mine. We could then see the end of that folder, and then I'm going to open it up inside
                  of Code Insiders, and here we can see we've got Cypress running. That was our end-to-end test. If we
                  look in the package. json, which is really the source of truth here, we can see we've got our
                  end-to-end tests, our unit tests on lines 9 and 10, we've got our router on line 15, our service
                  worker for our PWA in 13, Vuex on line 16, and so on and so forth. You may have also wondered, what
                  happens if your repository is private because maybe you didn't want to share the presets outside of
                  your company. Well you can do that too. Just make sure you set up your repo, and if it is private, use
                  the --clone option when you do a vue create with the preset.

                <h3>App Creation Options and What's Next?</h3>
                <p>
                  You just learned how to use the Vue CLI to create Vue applications in a variety of ways. You can use
                  the options like default and bare, or you can set the package manager to Yarn or npm. Sometimes we
                  need a little bit more customization on things so we can go through the manual process of all the
                  prompts by just running vue create with no options. And we also learned how we can use the vue presets
                  to create our own presets and then share them with other people. There's one other way to create Vue
                  applications, and that's using the Vue CLI's UI. We'll learn more about that in a later module. Next
                  up, let's learn how we can build and serve Vue applications.

              Vue</h2>
              <div>
                <h3>Overview of the Building and Serving</h3>
                <p>I'm a developer, and writing code is where it's at. But when we're done writing code, it's super
                  important to make sure you've got a good build process to make sure that you can build the
                  applications to deploy them effectively to your web servers. In this module, we're going to look
                  closely at how we can build and serve Vue applications using the Vue CLI. We'll kick things off by
                  going through the Vue CLI service and understanding its role in building and serving. We'll explore
                  serving first and look at the different options in how to serve our code, especially for that dev
                  development lifecycle. Then we'll look at building apps a little bit closer, and we can build
                  applications, we can build libraries, and we can build web components with the Vue CLI. By the end of
                  this module, you'll have a good understanding of the differences between apps, libraries, and web
                  components, and how to do them yourselves. </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Exploring the Vue CLI Service</h3>
                <p>
                  The heart and soul that makes building and serving work in the Vue CLI is the Vue CLI Service. When we
                  install the Vue CLI, we get this, and it's the vue-cli-service. It's the main tool for building and
                  serving. It uses webpack to do the builds and serves for us. And out of the box when we create a new
                  application, it creates npm scripts in the package. json file, so we can make running and building
                  super easy. The way we use the binary for our Vue CLI Service is to run the npm scripts, like npm run
                  serve. That'll build it up with webpack and then serve it in the browser. Another option is we could
                  access the binary directly in the node_modules folder, like this. It does the same thing, but I don't
                  know about you, but I'd rather run npm run serve. Another option is run npx vue-cli-service serve.
                  What this does right from the command line is you can run anything that's in the binary folder of
                  node_modules. Effectively in this case, npx is a shortcut to. /node_modules/. bin, but 99 times out of
                  100, you're just going to type npm run serve. If you want to use npx, you just require npm version 5.
                  2 or greater. Let's take a look inside of a project to see where all this comes into play. Here we
                  have the HEROES-VUE application that we pulled down from GitHub earlier in the course. If you need
                  that URL, here it is. Once we pull it down, we can open up the package. json, and notice that in here
                  we've got lines 6, 7, and 8, npm run serve, build, and lint. All three of those are using the Vue CLI
                  Service directly. And then I've extended my scripts with a couple commands to help run my specific
                  application. To fake a back end, I'm running a JSON server in the back end here, I've created npm run
                  quick, which concurrently runs npm run backend for the JSON server, and then also npm run serve. So I
                  can run this by going into my terminal here and typing npm run quick, which is going to run line 9,
                  which also runs line 12 and line 6 simultaneously here. So the CLI service is building the
                  application, and once it's ready, to launch it in the browser. Now we can click on the link, and we
                  can see the application running. And that's all we need to serve our application.
                </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Learning How to Serve Vue</h3>
                <p>It's time to learn how to use npm run serve. So we'll open up the HEROES-VUE application, we could
                  use any app really, but inside of here we're going to type in npm run serve. Now if we do that, if we
                  go back into package. json, we're going to see that npm run serve will run this Vue CLI Service for
                  us. And while it's building here, let's take a look at what else is needed in this project. This
                  project happens to need a back-end server, and I've got this backend command which will run a fake
                  back end for us. Now if I run the app by clicking here, you'll notice that the proxy error comes up
                  because it can't proxy from 9626 to port 9627 for my APIs. And this is what the app will look like
                  because it can't find the back-end database because it's on a different port. So what I'm going to do
                  is open up a split terminal here, and I'm also going to run npm run backend. Now if you're not running
                  this specific app, you won't need that here. But now if I go back to the application, and let's
                  refresh, the application works just fine. That's because the back end is on a different port, and this
                  is pretty common out there. So there's a couple things to dissect here. First, we ran npm run serve to
                  build our application in memory and then serve it up in the browser. And for those times we need to
                  hit a back end that has a separate API, there's a setting you can do inside of you by creating this
                  vue. config. js file down here. Notice inside the dev server we have this thing called proxy on line
                  6. The proxy is saying that whenever you see traffic trying to get to /api, which is what my client
                  Vue application is looking for, instead switch the port over to localhost 9627, which is where my
                  back-end server is running. Remember when we ran npm run serve, the application opened on 9626, and
                  then we got an error down here that said I can't find 9627. That's because the proxy was looking for
                  it down there. This is to avoid the CORS issue, or cross-origin issues, when you're running
                  applications that hit multiple ports. Long story short here, if you're running a Vue app and you have
                  no back end, no worries, or if it's being served from the same back end as you're serving your Vue
                  app. But quite often, you'll have a back end that runs on a different port. So this proxy API will
                  help you do that. Now there's other modes we could be running in. Let's go ahead and leave the back
                  end running, but over here we're going to stop the server from running. Instead, we can take a look at
                  some other options that we could have. If we do npx, got to make some room over here, vue-cli-service.
                  Remember npx is going to let me run this vue-cli-service without typing in. node_modules/. bin, etc.
                  Now we can do --help. We're going to see all the commands that we get running with serve. Now we could
                  say this and do serve right up there. We can open the browser on server start, which means we just
                  type something in like this with --open, and that'll run it and open it right in the browser. So let's
                  try that real quick. And there's the app. We'll cancel it again, we'll go back to running help. Copy
                  is nice too because we can run it and serve it, but maybe we don't want to open it in the browser,
                  maybe that's distracting. We can copy the URL of the browser to the clipboard by doing this, we can
                  change the mode by using mode, we can change the host and the port by using those settings, and of
                  course we can change to use HTTPS if we can get that running locally. So we've got a lot of options
                  here when we run our serve applications. Now my recommendation is, if you're going to change those
                  options up, like if you always want it to open, go open your package. json, go into serve or create a
                  new script, and do something like this here. That way you don't have to type all that in, and then you
                  can just type npm run serve. And that's how easy it is to serve your applications. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Serving with the Vue UI</h3>
                <p>One last thing to look at. Now let's cancel and close out both of our processes down here. And we'll
                  kill them, and we'll reopen the terminal. Just make sure we had nothing running there. Now I'm going
                  to run vue ui. So nothing is running, and we're going to run the vue ui. Now for that Vue UI, it
                  happened to be open on the Heroes project right now. If I wasn't, I could go down here to the bottom
                  left, hit the home key, and then I could import the project right in that folder. So I'm going to open
                  that one up. Now if I go down to the Tasks here on the left, notice I can click on serve, right here
                  on the left under Project tasks, and then I could run this task. Now before I do, notice there's
                  parameters. By default, serve is going to run in development mode. I could also serve it in production
                  mode if I want to. For now, let's keep it on development, and then I can run this task. Now notice
                  when I run this task, you're going to see a little animation on the right-hand side as it's building
                  the project for us. There is also Output right here next to the Dashboard. If we click on that, we can
                  see the process as it outputs all of the things that it's doing while it's building the project. Then
                  it launched the project. Again, I'm not running the back-end server here, so that's not working. When
                  we click back to the dashboard, we can see some data about what happened here. We have a rather large
                  application because we have made it for development and not for production. We can scroll back up and
                  look at the analyzer, which will show us what's inside of our bundle, so we can examine what files are
                  in there and what's being big. Now let's say we want to see this thing running. Remember, it wasn't
                  running up here. I can also scroll down, and you'll notice I've got my npm scripts here. I can run npm
                  run backend simply by cloning this task right here. Now if I go back to my app and I refresh it, I
                  have my data. We'll learn a whole lot more about the Vue UI in a later chapter, but this gives you a
                  taste of how you can use it to do the same commands that we ran right from the command line. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Understanding the Serving Options</h3>
                <p>Let's take a closer look at some of the commands that we ran when we were serving Vue with the Vue
                  CLI. First, we were serving with npm by simply doing npm run serve, we ran an npm script to run our
                  commands, but we can also use Yarn to do the same thing. So we could use yarn serve if Yarn is our
                  preference. So no worries, either way you roll, you're supported in the Vue CLI. We also saw a bunch
                  of the options that the Vue CLI service holds for us, like open, copy, mode, and host, and the port
                  and HTTPS. These are options that you can customize based upon what you're trying to accomplish in the
                  project. I recommend, again, that you put these in your npm scripts. We also took a look at how we
                  could proxy requests using the vue. config. js file. So, let's say we had a host server that's serving
                  our Vue application. Now it's going to send our JavaScript and CSS, and HTML up to our Vue client.
                  That's great, we've got our server, in this case maybe your laptop or desktop, running your
                  application and serving it. But then when you make a request from a Vue client to some kind of an API
                  back end, that's where the proxy comes into play and says, okay, you're asking to go to another back
                  end to get JSON, and that JSON is coming from, let's say, another server. In this case, we're running
                  it on a different port, which serves the same purpose. And we can do that by setting up that proxy
                  inside of the vue. congif. js file. Now you have everything you need to go try serving your
                  applications. So I recommend you take a timeout here and pause the video and go try serving your own
                  Vue application, and then come right back and we'll move on to building. </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Build Targets and Options</h3>
                <p>When we run npm run serve, we're building in memory and then showing the app in our browser, but when
                  we want to write our files out to the hard drive, like to a dist folder, that's when we need to build
                  with Vue. The Vue CLI Service does this for us. Some of the options you should be familiar with are
                  the mode, which by default is production, because when you're building and running the files to dist,
                  you're probably doing it for production, which is going to give you a more optimized build. You can
                  also set that to development. We can change the destination output directory, by default it is dist.
                  We can also set the modern flag, and this is going to target modern browsers with automatic fallback
                  to support browsers that don't support this. In effect, it's going to make your apps load faster on
                  the modern browsers. You can also change the target. By default, we're going to build an application,
                  or app, but you can change that to lib, or wc for library or web component. We're going to take a
                  closer look at all three of these so we can see the differences of them. And there's some other
                  options like no-clean where you don't remove the dist directory before you build, and there's report
                  and report-json for generating reports about the analysis of the bundles that you're creating. And
                  finally, if you want to build and then rebuild every time changes are made, you can set the watch
                  option. So how does this work? Well, we simply run npm run build, and out of the box we run the npm
                  script to do this, and it's going to do a production build for an application, of course. We can also
                  run vue-cli-service build with our target to be a library, if we want to build a component library,
                  for example, or something that has a bunch of Vue features in it that we want to pull into other
                  projects. We can then set the name of it and what the entry file is for that library. And maybe we
                  want to create a web component, so we can change the target to be a web component and then set the
                  entry component for that. Now the top command is shorter because we have an npm script to do that.
                  Otherwise it would be vue-cli-service build, and then --target app. Of course the npm script makes it
                  so much easier, so I recommend if you're building a library or a web component that you also create
                  npm scripts to run those. The really important parts here about the build targets are remember, if
                  you're building an application, by default that's just what you're doing with the build, and that's
                  --target app. If you're building a library you want to --target lib. And of course, you can build a
                  web component with --target wc. Now let's walk through some demos where we build an application, a
                  library, and a web component. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Building an App</h3>
                <p>Let's walk through building an application. We'll go into VS Code into the terminal, and in our vue
                  folder where we're creating some projects, we're going to create a new project that we will then build
                  and explore what that build does. Let's call this one vue build, just to take a look at what actually
                  gets created, and we're going to use the default flags. Once it's done, we will go into the folder
                  called vue build. If you look at it in the File Explorer over here, we see there's nothing there. So
                  inside of VS Code, we can write our code-insiders. We'll do dot and then /r, that's just going to
                  reopen it. Or you can just open it up in your favorite editor, either way. Now we can see that there
                  is our project, there is our components. We've got app vue, and it's using HelloWorld, you see it on
                  line 14 there and line 4. There is our HelloWorld with all the links and the basic stuff that you get
                  in a Vue application. So let's try to build this now. We'll go back into the terminal and we're going
                  to type npm run build. Now let's take a look at the package. json while that's happening here. Because
                  what I typed was what's on line 7. Effectively, that's just a script over the vue-cli-service build
                  command. And by default, it's doing a production build. Now this won't take very long because it was a
                  small project. It's the HelloWorld default project that comes out of the box. Here in the output you
                  can see that when we ran it, it's telling us it's building for production. That means it's going to be
                  optimized. You can see in the file names here, we've got these numbers at the end of the files. That
                  will change if any of the files or contents of those files change later when we do a rebuild. That's
                  for cache busting. You can see that the sizes, they've gotten smaller here. When you get gzip'd, and
                  what this build created was a bunch of files in the dist folder. We can see that here in the output.
                  So let's go look at the dist folder in the upper left now, and we can see that we've got CSS, our
                  images, and any JavaScript we might have. And inside the HTML, we can see that's all scrunched up on
                  one line, and we can see our script tags are up here for the JavaScript. If we wanted to, we could go
                  in and do a development build. That would give us less optimized code. That is not the default. We're
                  most often going to want to get a production build with the optimizations. Now how do we serve this
                  code? Well if you have your own web server, you can run it, or you can use a tool like http-server. I
                  don't have it installed, so I'm going to run as npx http-server, then I'm going to tell it run inside
                  the dist folder. Now this is going to run out to npm and pull down http-server, and then it's going to
                  run that, even though we haven't installed it here, that's the cool thing about npx, and it's going to
                  host it in the default port of 8080. You can then click on that, and then there is the application
                  running. Now if you go look at the Network tab, and then we refresh, we'll see there are those
                  application files for the JavaScript. If I click on All, we can see all the files that came across.
                  Then I'll close this browser, and then we can kill the process down there. What about some of the
                  other options we had? Well, let's go back to the package. json for a moment. Now let's create a new
                  script up here. We're going to call this one build fun. We're going to explore some of the different
                  things we can do with a build. And here, first, we're going to save vue-cli-service build, and then
                  we're going to do modern, just like that. So let's go ahead and run this. Now it's going to run the
                  same kind of build, but now it's actually going to take advantage of modern bundles for us. So let's
                  take a look at the output here. Still building for production, but now it says a modern bundle for
                  production. This modern bundle is a feature of the Vue CLI that uses something called modern mode.
                  Effectively what this means is that in the more modern browsers, the more recent ones, there's better
                  ways to send bundles that are smaller and more optimized to the browsers. Now this only works in the
                  latest browsers, that's why it's called modern. Well, the best of both worlds here is if we're using
                  the latest browsers, we want modern mode to be on because then we get less JavaScript being
                  transported to the browser, and it's faster to parse inside the browser. But we also don't want to
                  leave other users behind. Well, modern mode is good about this because it'll create the modern bundles
                  and it'll create the bundles that the older browsers support with a fallback. Don't worry, both aren't
                  being sent. Effectively it writes the code to make sure that if can support modern mode, that's what's
                  sent. If not, it goes and gets the other ones. So we benefit with faster bundles and faster apps.
                  Let's take a look what that means. Here's the output right there. Now if we go back up into the dist
                  folder, we look inside JavaScript, you can see we have some files called legacy. Legacy are the older
                  ones, not the modern mode, and then for example here, chunks-vendor, the bottom one? That is the one
                  that's been developed for modern mode. So that's why we have four JavaScript files in this case. So to
                  wrap up, the Vue CLI is going to produce two versions of your app. One with the modern bundle here,
                  that's going to target modern browsers that support ES modules, and then another set of files that
                  supports the legacy bundling that targets older browsers. </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Building a Library</h3>
                <p>One thing you're likely to want to do is create a component library at some point. So how can you do
                  that with Vue? Let's create a new project here that shows how to do it. We're going to do
                  vue-hello-lib. We call these libraries. Now I'm going to set -d there just to get us the defaults. Now
                  let's go into the folder, and let's open up the editor right where we are. If we look at the folder,
                  we have a project here where we've got App. vue, and it's loading HelloWorld, which is another
                  component inside of here. Nothing so far about this project has anything to do with a library, but
                  we're going to make it one. Effectively, we want the HelloWorld component, and we could add others as
                  well, to be something we could reuse. Let's make this component a little simpler. We're just going to
                  keep that h1 up there. There we go. So this is going to be our HelloWorld, and it's going to say hello
                  world as part of the message that gets passed in. And just to make it super simple, we're just going
                  to add hello in the h1. Once we have a component that we want to export, one thing we could do here is
                  create a file, and we're going to call it index. js, which effectively is going to be a way to barrel
                  all of our components together and export them. We'll start off by importing Vue from vue, and then
                  we're going to import our component. And then we need to tell Vue that these exist. So we're going to
                  do vue. component, and then give them names. We need to repeat this for every component that you have.
                  Then finally, we're going to export this as a default object. And in case we have series of them, we
                  could export them in series here. So if I have HelloWorld and I had another one, maybe like
                  ModalWindow, and I had another one that was Foo, I could put them like this. How you export them is
                  really up to you. This becomes our main file, our entry point, for building our library. So when
                  somebody consumes our library, this is the file they're going to look at for, hey, what does that
                  library have inside of it? Next, we're going to create a vue. config file, and we're doing this
                  because we want Vue to know that we're going to have a library export that uses defaults. So we're
                  going to say module. exports. If you've already got a vue. congif file, just use the existing one. Now
                  we can say configureWebpack, and then we're going to use output, and then libraryExport. The next set
                  of steps all involves package. json. In the package. json, we want to set a few things up. There's the
                  name of our project, the version, whether it's private or not. We're going to create what you call a
                  main file, that's going to be the entry point, which is going to be the index file we created. We'll
                  tell it which files to include on npm when we publish these to npm, and then we'll create a build
                  script in here so you don't have to type the whole build script out. So taking a step back, remember
                  what we're going here is we're taking a project, and we're really using those components so we can
                  publish them in a library form, possibly on public npm, or in an internal npm server, or company, so
                  we can then consume them from another project and reuse them, effectively creating reusable
                  components. So the name's important. Now, let's say I was going to put this publicly. I might have a
                  scoped project, and here I could just say we can call it our, we'll just call it the same name. Yours
                  wouldn't be called @johnpapa, and if you don't have scope projects, you'll probably just want to call
                  it something straight up like this, like vue-hello-lib. You'll give it a version number. You may want
                  it to be private. In this case, I don't, because I'm going to publish it. Next let's create our main
                  file. Now the main file's going to be what is that entry point to this application? It's going to be
                  in the dist folder, and this is going to be called what? Vue-hello-lib, and then it's going to be
                  common. js. This is going to be the built version of our project, and that's going to be the file that
                  runs right out of the gate. We'll take a look at this when we do the build, we should have a file
                  that's named this. This naming convention is basically dist, that's the output folder when we do a
                  build, vue-hello-lib, name of our project,. common. js. We'll come back to that and verify it's right.
                  Next, we want to include our files. We'll be pretty explicit here. I want to say that I want to
                  publish all of my distribution files, that's your source code that's compiled and optimized. Next,
                  we'll put our source code out there, because in this case I happen to want to publish it. I'm also
                  going to publish the public folder and any JSON or JavaScript files. Finally, we don't want to be
                  typing a long build script in, so I'm going to create a new one here called build-lib, just to show
                  the differences. We're going to get rid of the left-hand pane for the Explorer so we can see it as I
                  type in, we're going to use a vue-cli-service to build. This time we're going to do a target, though,
                  of lib. Remember the default target is app. We don't want app, we want a library. We want to name our
                  project, so we're going to use --name. This is going to be vue-hello-lib. Now this is any name you
                  want. I happened to pick the same name as our project. This will then match what's up on main, right
                  here, in vue-hello-lib. And finally, remember that index file we had, and I'll peek back over at it,
                  over here in the components? We want to point to where do you start, what are we actually exposing
                  here? So it's going to be building something that's in src/components, and then index. js. Now you can
                  see why we're putting this in npm scripts because I don't want to be typing that. So let's scroll up
                  so we can see that command and let's open up our integrated terminal. And let's give it a shot. We'll
                  run npm run, and then build-lib. It should be building our library. And there we go, it compiled super
                  fast. Now you may think, wow, that was really fast, like almost too fast because it's faster than an
                  application in a lot of cases, and you'd be right. One of the things about building a library is Vue
                  is externalized from the bundles. That's a really important point, because when you're building
                  components and you're going to pull it into other projects, if those are Vue components, then Vue
                  should already be in the other project. You don't want to be constantly building and bundling Vue in
                  every project. Now let's go look at the output in the dist folder right here. We have our different
                  bundles, and we have a demo. html. Let's take a look at that for a moment. The demo. html is going to
                  pull in our script file and our CSS, and it's just going to call this library name. Now that's not so
                  useful in our case. What we really want to do at this point is, if you have an npm account or an
                  internal npm server, or are using other tools like Artifact running locally on your machine in your
                  network that you want to publish them to, you can then publish this library. And the command you'd use
                  to do that is npm publish if you're going to npm. We're not going to publish this publicly on npm,
                  because, well, this one doesn't do a whole lot. But if all we'd have to do to pull this in after we
                  publish it is then install this library, which would be called what? The name is in package. json,
                  @johnpapa/vue-hello-lib. So all we'd have to do in another project is type in npm install @johnpapa,
                  kind of like we do with vue/cli, and then it's vue-hello-lib, like that. We could do --save-dev or
                  just save, or whatever we want to do. That's once we publish it out to an npm server. And then inside
                  of our project, to use that component we would just simply import HelloWorld, or whatever we called
                  our components, from @johnpapa/vue-hello-lib. That's really all there is to building a library with
                  Vue. </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Building a Web Component</h3>
                <p>
                  There will be times where you might want to create a web component with your Vue components. Let's
                  take this same application, vue-hello-lib, where we have our HelloWorld component, and instead of
                  building a library, let's build it as a web component. So down here, instead of getting rid of or
                  changing our lib on line 16 for build-lib, we're going to make one called build-wc. Now the target is
                  not going to be lib, it's going to be wc. You have to change a few other things at this point. We're
                  going to change the name slightly to wc here, just because we want to show the difference, but you
                  don't have to do that. What's more important is you have to tell the entry file. Instead of getting a
                  list of components in this case, now we're listing out the web component we want to use. And here
                  we're going to list out the name of the web component that we want to compile. And this will build our
                  web component. So now we can go back into our terminal, and I'll open up the file over here on the
                  left for the Explorer. Let's run npm run build-wc. Now it's building our web component and it's
                  putting it in the dist folder, and now notice that we just have a JavaScript file, a minified version
                  and a non-minified version. And there it is. If we look inside our demo, we can see that we can pull
                  in our JavaScript file, and we should simply be able to use vue-hello-lib-wc. Also notice that we're
                  pulling in Vue in this case in the demo from a CDN, for one package. But we could pull it into any Vue
                  app we want by simply dropping this script tag on line 4 into a page, and then using it like we did
                  right here on line 7. Let's use npx to open up an HTTP server. It'll pull that down and we're going to
                  serve the dist folder. Now once we do that, we'll open this up inside of a browser, and now let's
                  browse to demo. html. Why? Before we browse to it, we're looking over here, that is the name of the
                  HTML file we're going to run. So let's run to that, and there is our Hello component. If we look
                  inside of our component itself, we can see that it has a prop called message that it's going to print
                  out. So let's go back to our HTML here, now let's type messages=John. Let's go back to the browser and
                  refresh, and now it says Hello John. And we just built our first web component with Vue.
                </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Using the Vue UI to Build</h3>
                <p>We've been using the terminal to build our applications, but we can also use the Vue UI from the Vue
                  CLI. So let's stop the running application if you have one, and let's go back to our HelloWorld app.
                  And we can reopen code. So here's our basic HelloWorld app we created earlier in the course. Now, of
                  course, we can build from here, but instead of building from here, let's just open up the Vue UI. We
                  don't have to be in the same folder as the project we want to build. It just opens up the Vue UI, and
                  then if you hit the home button on the bottom left, you'll see a list where you can look at your
                  projects you've already looked at, or you can create a new one, or you can import one from a folder.
                  Let's use HelloWorld since we looked at that earlier. Then we'll click on our clipboard over here,
                  those are our tasks. We can click on build, and before we click on run, notice the parameters. By
                  default it's production. We can also set our output, our build target for Web app, Library, Web
                  component, or Asynchronous web component, and set other options down here. Let's run this build. At
                  the bottom you see a status that it's running. And then here, it's actually building and we saw the
                  animations as it happened. Now it gives us some speed stats for how long it would take to load over
                  these different connections, and then the file sizes are parsed, then of course what the different
                  speeds would be. What I find more interesting sometimes is the output because that shows you exactly
                  which command ran. This is a great way to learn the CLI commands by watching the Vue UI run them. So
                  here it said it ran build with mode production, it put it in the dist folder, and it's targeting the
                  application. If you need to clear this output, you just click the little trashcan over here, Clear
                  console. Dashboard is what we looked at, and then Analyzer is what's going to show us what's inside of
                  the files. Here we can see the main. js, the assets, App. vue, and so on and so forth. And HelloWorld
                  should be over here. Now this is a very tiny app, but it shows you how we can use the Vue UI to run
                  the same commands as a CLI. </p>

                <h3>Wrap up and What's Next?</h3>
                <p>In this module we learned how to build and serve our Vue applications using the Vue CLI and the Vue
                  UI. At the heart of this is the Vue CLI Service, which we can then run with the npx command to run the
                  binaries or we can use npm scripts to do those with serve or build. Those npm scripts can be nice
                  little shortcuts so we don't have to type out the long commands of the Vue CLI Service with our
                  special options that we want to add in. And if we want to optimize our builds, we can use production
                  mode to get them as small as possible, and of course we can build applications, which is the default
                  target, or libraries or web components. And at the end of the day, you can use the Vue CLI commands
                  directly from the terminal or you can go back to the Vue UI and run the commands interactively in a
                  visual way so you can analyze your bundles. Now that we've learned how to build and serve our
                  applications, let's move on to learning how we can test our applications with the Vue CLI. </p></div>

                <h3>Overview of Testing with the Vue CLI</h3>
                <p>One of the key aspects to using the Vue CLI is how easy it makes it to write and run and then rerun
                  end-to-end and unit tests. In this module, you'll learn how to use the Vue CLI to test your Vue
                  applications both with unit tests, of course with all the options you have with unit tests, and with
                  end-to-end testing and looking at the options for end-to-end testing that come out of the box with the
                  Vue CLI. Let's dive in. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>How to Set up and Run Unit Tests with Mocha or Jest</h3>
                <p>Unit testing is an important part of creating applications to maintain the integrity and to maintain
                  it long term. The Vue CLI makes it easy to run your unit tests, and out of the box you can run them
                  with Mocha and Chai or with Jest, two very popular unit testing frameworks. You can find more
                  information about these two frameworks at the links provided here. Let's take a look at how you'd run
                  those unit tests. Out of the box, you get an npm script that says npm run test:unit. If you run that,
                  well, it's going to run your unit test for you. The way you get these is when you go through creating
                  a Vue application, when you select that you want unit tests, it'll automatically ask you do you want
                  Mocha or Jest, and then it'll set up these npm scripts for you. You can also execute this, which is
                  the longer way to get to the binary. We learned about this previously with other commands from the Vue
                  CLI service, which is really just at the core of all the commands you run with the Vue CLI. And if you
                  want to run it straight from a command line, there is a shortcut if you're using npm version 5. 2 or
                  higher, and that's using npx. We'll be using the top command, npm run test:unit, and if we want to
                  customize any of our options for unit testing, we'll just edit the npm scripts to make our lives easy.
                  When you're choosing your options for testing, they may differ based on whether you choose Mocha or
                  Jest. Let's explore that. Now if we want to see the different options, we know we can run --help. Now
                  we just heard that these options might be different based upon the different framework. That kind of
                  makes sense under the covers, and what this is telling us is the Vue CLI is effectively just using the
                  underlying framework. It's not putting a whole lot on top of them, it's just letting you use those
                  two, Mocha or Jest, with Vue. So effectively, it allows all the options from the underlying test
                  provider. Now if you want to know what options you have for those testing providers, you should see
                  those docs for full details. Now we can run the help command here, and when you run them, based upon
                  whether you chose Mocha or Jest, you might see different options. So you can find those options here
                  at the links for Mocha and Jest. The good news is you're not learning a whole new language here. If
                  you're familiar with Mocha, just use those. If you're familiar with Jest, use them. If you're just
                  getting started, I kind of like Jest. Now that we've learned how to run our unit tests, let's go
                  through creating a project and set up some unit tests and run them. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Learning How to Run Unit Tests with the Vue CLI</h3>
                <p>
                  Let's go into a folder where we can create a new project to create a set of unit tests and then run
                  them through the Vue CLI. We'll use the Vue CLI to create the project, of course, vue create, and
                  we'll call this in Vue Test and we'll use Jest. So I'm just going to call the project Jest. I'm not
                  going to give it any options out of the box because we're going to walk through them manually for now.
                  Remember, you can always go back later and create your own presets. So I'm going to manually choose
                  the features. In this case, I'm going to slide down to Unit Testing and just select that, and then
                  I'll select ESlint plus Prettier. Now we can choose Mocha and Chai or Jest. I'm going to choose Jest
                  in this case, and Dedicated Config Files, and then we're not going to save it as a preset for now.
                  Once the project is created, we go into our Vue Test Jest folder. Let's open up our favorite editor.
                  Now we can look at the project over here on the left. I always like to start by looking at package.
                  json to see what happened. Here we can see that we have an additional script on line 9 for testing
                  unit tests. It's going to use the Vue CLI service and run test:unit. And if we look at the
                  dependencies, we're going to see some testing dependencies down here. Notice we have babel-jest on
                  line 23. And of course we have the plugin for the Vue CLI on line 17 to run our Jest tests. So now we
                  should be able to run npm run test:unit. Let's try that from the integrated terminal here. We'll do
                  npm run test:unit, and it's running through and there's an example spec that gets created out of the
                  box, and notice it's passing. The great thing here is all of your testing comes out of the box ready
                  to go. All you have to do is write the test. Notice it's telling us where the tests are right under
                  tests/unit/example. spec. So we can go to Tests, Unit, example. spec, right there. Now we can see our
                  test, this is the one that comes out of the box. Now let's imagine we wrote a new component. We'll go
                  up under the src, under components. Let's create a new one here, we're going to call it the HiChild
                  because it's going to be a child component that says hi. Now I'm going to use some snippets to create
                  this component. As a refresher, I've loaded an extension that we looked at earlier in the course. If
                  we look at my extensions down here towards the bottom, you're going to see Vue VSCode Snippets by
                  Sarah Drasner. And using those snippets, I can type vbase up top and hit Tab, and it's going to give
                  me the basic outline of a component. Now our component's going to be pretty simple. We're going to put
                  an h2 up top and it's going to say the child says, and then we're going to have a message, like this.
                  Now down inside the component, we're going to use a vprops snippet to put in our prop, and we'll make
                  it a little bit bigger so we can see, and a prop name's going to be message. So we're going to pass
                  the message in. The type is going to be a string and the default is going to be quotes. Now let's set
                  up an interesting rule. Maybe the message has to use a bigger word than just hi, for example. The
                  point here is they want to set up rules so that if there's some kind of validation or any kind of
                  computeds in our components, we know how to test them. Underneath the props, let's add a computed, and
                  I'm going to use the vcomputed snippet. We're going to create one called error, we're going to say
                  this. message. trim. length is less than three characters, we'll use a ternary here, say The child can
                  say bigger words than that! Otherwise, there really is no error message, and if it's less than three
                  characters, such as a word like hi, it'll have this error message. Or we're going to display it. Let's
                  create a div up top, and inside the div let's create a vif so if the error exists, let's go ahead and
                  print the message out for the error. Pretty simple. Now we're intentionally not going to put this
                  component anywhere yet. We just want to test the component out. And while this is not a course on
                  testing Vue, I think it's important to understand how we could test it so we can see how the different
                  commands work with the Vue CLI. So let's go back to Test and the example. spec, and let's add in our
                  component. We'll just copy that first one because we want to add the HiChild, so now we're importing
                  it, and we'll create a new describe. So I'm just going to copy the first one there. Be careful copying
                  and pasting, of course, and we'll first just test it out. Now this one has a prop called message, and
                  we'll just say hello there as the first one, and we're going to mount the HiChild and then message is
                  going to be used and injected in. So now we basically just did the same test we did for hello world,
                  but with hi child. The biggest differences are first, the hello world is what we're doing up top, down
                  below it's hi child, and the second one is that there's a prop called message, msg, and down here it's
                  called message, the full word. So if we go back to our specs, we can run the same command, npm run
                  test:unit, now it's going to run those, it should run both tests. Notice they both pass. Now we've
                  seen how we can write unit tests for new components and then execute them. The next step would be to
                  learn how we can do a little bit more with it by adding watchers and other options.
                </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Watching and Refactoring Unit Tests</h3>
                <p>We just wrote the HiChild component, which will show a message, and if the message is shorter than
                  three characters, it's going to show an error message there. But how do we test this? Under example.
                  spec, we can write a new it, basically a new test. So let's just copy the other it for a moment. We'll
                  change the message because that's not what we're going to test. It should say that it should render
                  the error when the message is too short. So, let's go ahead and we're going to mount the child like
                  this, and first we're going to pass in a short message, like hi, it's only two characters. We need a
                  way to find the elements. Let's go back to our component and let's assume we have a class on here, and
                  it's going to be called our error class that has some styling to go along with it, but this is also
                  going to allow us to find that element. So now we can say, all right, expect the wrapper to find the
                  error class, and if it exists, then expect that to be true. So should it be true if there's only a
                  two-character word in there? Yes. Now let's do the same thing, but change the message. So now we'll go
                  back into wrapper and we'll call setProps, and inside of there we'll set the message to something
                  longer. And this time, let's expect that should be false. So effectively, the first message is an
                  error and the second message is not. Now, let's go back and run our tests here. We're going to make a
                  little room on the screen by getting rid of the Explorer for a moment, and we'll pull up our terminal.
                  And if I run the unit test once, we should end up having more unit tests this time. Now we've got
                  three, and all three have passed. Well, let's test this out a moment. Let's go ahead and change hi to
                  hello. Now this should no longer be true, it should be false, so if we run this, we should have a
                  failed test. And we do have some errors, now we can see there's a failed test. So we've done some
                  basic unit testing here, but how do we know if these tests worked or didn't? Well, let's check our
                  help. So if I run npx vue-cli-service test:unit --help, we should see what commands we have. And lo
                  and behold, we have a watch flag. So, we could run the whole test command straight up from here with
                  npx and then run it with --watch, like this. But let's do what I said we should do, which is go inside
                  of the package. json, I'll go find that, and let's go to unit test and let's just add on the end of it
                  --watch. Now we'll go back into our terminal and we'll type in run test:unit, and now it's running
                  those unit tests with a watcher. Notice that it's still failed one and passed two, but it's giving us
                  an option because it's waiting at this point to see if any files are going to change, it'll rerun
                  them. And notice you've got the Watch Usage here, you can use a to run all the tests or f to run only
                  the failed tests, and so on and so forth. These are features you get by using Jest with Vue. So let's
                  go back to our spec, and let's change hello back to hi, and as soon as it picks up on the file change,
                  notice it reran the test, and now they pass. We can change that again to hi hi hi, and every time it
                  sees the file saved, it's going to rerun those tests. And to stop it from running, we can just hit
                  Ctrl+C down in our terminal, make sure the focus is down there, and it'll stop the test the running.
                  So now you know how to set up your tests and you can write as many as you need, and then run them with
                  the Vue CLI. </p></div>

                <h3>How to Set up End-to-end Tests with Cypress or Nightwatch
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Unit testing is great for testing a specific unit or set of code, but I also really like end-to-end
                  testing because it tests an interaction with the user. And we can do end-to-end testing with Vue, and
                  it's very easy to set this up with the Vue CLI. Let's learn how. By default, you're going to get a
                  couple different options out of the box for end-to-end testing tools, Cypress. io and Nightwatch. js.
                  And to run either one of these, after you choose which one you want, you can just run npm run
                  test:e2e; e2e stands for end to end. If you want to learn about these two different products, you can
                  either go to cypress. io or you can go to nightwatchjs. org to learn about them. There are plugins
                  that allow both of these products to work with Vue through the CLI. So to run these, we said that we
                  can run npm run test:e2e. That is going to be an npm script that gets added to our package. json, just
                  like we had an npm script added for other things we did, like if we added unit tests. Under the
                  covers, that's running. /node_modules/. bin/vue-cli-service test:e2e, and we can also use npx to run
                  it as a shortcut. That's the way I prefer to do it, as long as you're using npm 5. 2 or higher. Now
                  let's go create a project together with the Vue CLI that'll set up our end-to-end tests for us and
                  show how we can run them.
                </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Learning How to Run End-to-end Tests with the Vue CLI</h3>
                <p>
                  Let's go ahead and create a new project where we can set up our end-to-end tests. I'm going to
                  navigate back to my PlayVue folder, and we're going to use the Vue CLI once again to create a project.
                  This should be very familiar for you now. I'll call this one VueTest, and then we'll call it Cypress.
                  And we'll choose Manual Options here, we'll manually select the features, and this time we're only
                  going to select end-to-end testing in addition with the defaults. Obviously, we can select more if we
                  want to. Now I'll select ESlint and Prettier, lint onSave, and I could choose Cypress or Nightwatch.
                  I'm going to choose Cypress in this case, and then dedicated package. json files, and not a preset.
                  And now it's going to install everything we need. Excellent. Now we can go into the VueTest Cypress
                  folder, we'll open up our favorite code editor, and now let's take a quick look at the project once
                  again. First, let's start a package. json. Now we can see our script on line 9 for running the
                  end-to-end tests. If we look at our dependencies, we have a plugin on line 16 for the end-to-end test
                  for Cypress, just like we had a plugin for our unit test earlier for Jest. This is what lights up the
                  Cypress features with the Vue CLI. Now we've also got a cypress. json file over here, and it's showing
                  us where the tests are stored and the plugins file, these are for options for running Cypress. You can
                  learn more about those options on the Cypress. io website. Let's go take a look at the tests that it
                  created for us. Here is the default test, it's called My First Test, and the way this works is it, the
                  test, is going to visit the app URL. So, cy is the Cypress runner, it's going to visit slash, or
                  default route, and then it's going to see if it contains an h1 that says Welcome to Your Vue. js App.
                  Well, if we go look at our application under src, there's our app Vue, notice around line 4 it says
                  Welcome to Your Vue. js App, which is getting passed into Hello World, which is in our components
                  right here and displayed through the h1 on line 3, so this should work. Well, should and did are two
                  different things, so let's go back to package. json, refresh our memories on what this script is
                  called, test:e2e. We'll open up our terminal, and then we'll run that command, make it so we can see
                  both, type npm run test:e2e, and then we hit Enter. Now it's going to start up the development server
                  because it needs to run the app so it can run the test and it's going to need to use Cypress to run
                  it. Notice it's opening up the Cypress Test Runner. Now you can learn a whole lot more about Cypress
                  and also Nightwatch at the two different sites respectively, but notice one thing up here which I find
                  really interesting, you can run it in Chrome or you can run Electron. I happen to like running it in
                  Electron because I feel like it's a little more stable for me, but you can run it either way. And then
                  to run the tests themselves, you just can double-click on the tests like this and run it, and then the
                  runner will open up and execute the tests. And then you can use all the Cypress features to rerun the
                  test or actually examine what's happening inside them. So let's keep the runner open over here on the
                  right-hand side, and I'll try to make it a little bit less painful to look at, there we go, and we'll
                  minimize the actual runner and we can see here's the output. Let's put VS Code on the left and let's
                  make a change. Notice the tests are still running and they're looking at things. If we go into the
                  Hello World, right here, that's where the message is. What if we got rid of that h1, what would
                  happen? We save our file, it's recompiling down here, the test isn't looking at it. Now we can rerun
                  the test right here and notice it's visiting that site, but it's having a problem here and it timed
                  out. It said it timed out trying to find the content. Of course, because we deleted the h1. If we put
                  the h1 back, but we do something different, like we go to the app Vue, and this time we change the
                  Welcome to Your Vue. js App to say, Welcome to Vue, and we save that, then we rerun the test after it
                  compiles on the left, it's going to go and try again. And this time it's probably going to time out
                  again because it still doesn't quite match what we were looking for in the spec, which we can remind
                  ourselves of by going and looking at that spec. It's looking for Welcome to Your Vue. js App, but now
                  we can make the spec match that, should recompile, and rerun our test over here on the right-hand
                  side. Now you can say how easy it is to set up end-to-end testing inside of your applications with Vue
                  CLI.

                <p>
                  In this module, you learned how you can use the Vue CLI to both create projects that include unit
                  testing and end-to-end testing. And then we learned how we can run those unit and end-to-end tests. We
                  can choose Mocha or Jest for our unit tests right out of the box, and we can choose end-to-end tests
                  with Cypress of Nightwatch out of the box. Whichever you choose, it's super easy to run those tests
                  using the npm scripts, npm run test:unit or :e2e. We can also run these tests or create projects with
                  those tests using the Vue UI. We'll take a look at that in one of the upcoming modules. And what
                  lights up all these tests are the plugins for these different testing platforms. We're going to take a
                  closer look at how we can add other plugins into our projects using the Vue CLI in the next module.

              Plugins to Your Vue App with the Vue CLI</h2>
              <div>
                <h3>Overview of Plugins for the Vue CLI</h3>
                <p>
                  One of the most common things you're going to do when building a Vue application is want to extend
                  your application with other dependencies, with packages, and plugins to really light up some of the
                  features in your app. In this module, we'll talk about how you can do that using the Vue CLI. First,
                  we'll start off understanding what Vue plugins are, and then how we can use those not only to install
                  dependencies, but also to configure our applications. We'll explore how we can find these Vue plugins,
                  then of course we'll walk through how you can add and use the plugins in your applications. Let's dive
                  in.
                </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Understanding Vue CLI Plugins</h3>
                <p>A great place to start with plugins and packages is to understand what they do for you. A plugin's
                  going to extend your Vue application, and usually they're going to install dependencies and some of
                  them will actually ask you questions, like prompts. We've already seen some of these when we did the
                  Vue CLI's vue create option when it installed some plugins out of the box for us. In those cases, like
                  with ESLint, it asked us questions about what we wanted with ESLint, for example, whether we want to
                  fix on save or not, and those answers are then used to figure out how to hook up the application with
                  those plugins. Okay, so I've already revealed what are plugins. The ESLint one was one of the examples
                  we have, but traits of the plugins are you'll see that they begin with these names, either scoped with
                  @vue and then cli-plugin- or just vue-cli-plugin-, for example, ESLint or PWA. And the way you add
                  these is with the vue add command with the Vue CLI. Some of them are integrated right into the CLI
                  like ESLint or PWA, and some of them also have their own presets, or prompts, to configure it. There
                  are two very notable special cases with the naming convention. The first one is vue-router and the
                  other is vuex. Both of these are very popular and odds are you're going to run across using one or
                  both of these. Neither one of them follows the same naming convention that we mentioned above. But in
                  general, that's the naming convention you're going to look for right up top here. Okay, so when we're
                  adding a scoped plugin with @vue, the way it works, use the vue add command, and we can omit the
                  cli-plugin- portion of the name. For example, we could say vue add @vue/cli-plugin-pwa. Now that would
                  add the PWA plugin after we already have an existing app. But we could also use this command, which
                  does the same exact thing. Notice we're omitting the cli-plugin-. This is how you'd add the PWA plugin
                  to an existing Vue app. And this works for @vue scoped plugins. If you see plugins with the other
                  naming convention, the vue-cli-plugin-, you can install those using this command, vue add, then you
                  just use the full name, that'll add the Apollo plugin, for example, or you could just do vue add
                  apollo and that would do the same thing. Now as you might have guessed, most people just use the
                  shortcuts. What about those prompts or the presets that we talked about? If you did vue add
                  @vue/eslint, which is the shortcut syntax to add the ESLint plugin to your application, you would be
                  asked some questions. Those are the prompts. Now you can skip those prompts by passing generator
                  options right into the command. And the way you can do that is to call the same command, but then pass
                  in those options. In this case, it's looking for configuration with --config, and here we're choosing
                  airbnb, and also we're choosing lintOn to be save. Now, other than some of the plugins we've mentioned
                  here, where would you find a lot of plugins? Well, a good old Google search will work, but you can
                  also start with the Vue docs. That's what I recommend. Go there and then look through the rich
                  ecosystem in the menu structure in the documentation because they point out an awesome list and a
                  bunch of other ideas for how you can find really rich plugins. Now that we've learned about the
                  plugins and how we can add them, let's go do it together. </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Adding a Plugin Via the Vue CLI</h3>
                <p>Let's walk through creating a project to see what the experience is for getting plugins right out of
                  the gate, and then also to add plugins to an existing project. To start things off, we'll use vue
                  create, and we'll do vue-plugin-demo as the name of the project. And let's choose just -d for default.
                  Then we'll go into the folder called vue-plugin-demo and we'll open up our favorite code editor. Now
                  we'll take a quick look here inside the package. json and we'll see some things in here about the
                  plugins that we may not have noticed before. Notice on lines 14, 15, and 16, we see some Vue CLI
                  dependencies. The first two are plugins. By default, we get the plugin for babel and for eslint. These
                  are the defaults that we selected when we chose -d. Now let's get back to the terminal for a moment,
                  we'll do it inside of the integrated terminal now, and if we type vue create, and we'll just do foo,
                  just to see what those questions look like, and we'll cancel out of this in a moment. If you manually
                  select the features, a lot of these features that we're selecting were hooked in through the plugins.
                  For example, there's our Linter, that's the ESLint plugin right there, and notice Babel has been
                  selected up top. Well, what if you already had a project and you forgot to select you wanted
                  progressive web app support, what do you do? Well, I'm going to cancel out of this for now, and let's
                  say we already had this project called vue-plugin-demo and we wanted to add those. So we'd open up our
                  terminal, I'll pull it up a little bit, we'll kind of keep an eye on the scripts and we'll keep an eye
                  on the dev dependencies, now we can type vue add. Now before we type too much more, let's type help
                  just so I can show the syntax here. So you type vue add, and then the name of the plugin that we want,
                  and then any options that could be optional at the end of it. So we'll type vue add down here, and
                  let's say PWA. And the name of this would be @vue/pwa, because remember, we can do the shortcut
                  syntax. Or alternatively, we could've done cli-plugin-pwa, but let's use the shortcut syntax. And now
                  when we add that, it's running through and installing it for us, and if there's any questions to ask,
                  it will ask us those through the prompts. Now note first, I already had committed all my changes. When
                  you get a new project, they're already committed. When I add a new plugin, it's going to make some
                  changes to files. Minimally, it's going to change the package. json. With the PWA, it changed a heck
                  of a lot more. It added a bunch of files, and it tells you right here in the output, which is great,
                  there were no prompts, so no questions to ask, but notice now in the git diff, we can see all the
                  files that were changed or modified. All the Us are the new files, and the Ms are the modified ones.
                  So I click on package. json right there, we can see there's a new dependency for
                  register-service-worker, and then a dev dependency for the CLI plugin for PWA. Then the main. js file
                  also changed because then it's importing this file called register-service-worker, and that's the new
                  file there, which gives us a service worker for our Vue app. I highly recommend before you run vue add
                  on any of your code, you first commit all your changes to Git. So let's do that now, let's say I'm
                  good with the PWA, so I'll commit those changes. Now I followed the directions here, I did Cmd+Enter
                  to commit them. You can also come up here and then choose Commit. Well now let's say we wanted to add
                  a different one, we wanted to come through here and do add apollo, which again, this is not a scoped
                  package, so here we could have typed in vue-cli-plugin-apollo. I don't know about you, but I'm much
                  happier just typing vue add apollo. Remember I committed the changes first, so now it's going to go
                  out and install this plugin for us. And once it's done installing, we'll see the Git changes show up
                  in the Source Control pane once again. Now notice this one does have a prompt. Here it's asking would
                  you like to add any example code? You can say yes or no, no is the default. I'm going to choose yes.
                  Would you like to add a server? I'm going to say no. And then it's going to finish all of its
                  installation. And again, once it's completed we can look at the git diff to see what's actually been
                  changed. Notice now it actually changed the code, it didn't just add code, but it changed the code for
                  one of the components to load ApolloExample instead of HelloWorld. And if we look at main. js, it
                  added apolloProvider in there and it put it into the stack to crank it up when view starts, and of
                  course we got our package. json changes. If we look over at our code and our components, we still have
                  HelloWorld, it just added this other component and made that the thing that was cranking up out of the
                  box right there on line 4. Now let's say I change my mind, I don't really want these. There's a simple
                  way to undo these changes. I can discard them all right there by clicking on the button over in source
                  control, and then choosing Discard All 14 files. And now we no longer have in the package. json
                  anything to do with Apollo. So you've learned three things about plugins with our projects. We can use
                  vue create and then select a bunch of plugins right out of the gate, or we can add plugins to an
                  existing project with vue add, and third, and probably most importantly, we should always commit our
                  changes before we actually run vue add because then we can revert them if we want to, or we can just
                  see at least all the files that changed inside of our project. </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Invoking a Plugin Via the Vue CLI</h3>
                <p>There may be a time where you've got a plugin in your application, but you want to change how you
                  configured it. For example, maybe you have ESLint set up in your project, but then you want to change
                  the configurations that you selected. You can do this using the invoke command of the CLI. This is
                  ideal for when you want to change something that you've already configured with a plugin. So the
                  syntax would be vue invoke, and then the plugin name. So let's say that we added eslint with either
                  vue create or vue add vue/eslint to your project, later we could then run vue invoke @vue/eslint, and
                  that will run through the generator's prompts once again so you can reconfigure it. Let's go try this
                  out together. Back in our project called vue-plugin-demo, we already had eslint configured, and also
                  pwa and babel. So instead of typing in just vue add, instead we're going to type vue invoke, and then
                  I like to do help first to see what the syntax looks like, so we'll do vue invoke. We know it's
                  @vue/eslint. And it's going to run through now and ask us the configuration for this plugin. Remember,
                  we're not adding from scratch, but we're just changing the configuration. And just like with vue add,
                  I always like to commit first so I can see what the changes will be. So let's say I wanted to change
                  to use Airbnb. We'll select that and we'll do Lint and fix on commit just to show what it looks like.
                  Notice right out of the gate, we're seeing some changes over on the left. We can take a look at these
                  as it's going through. So here is the editor config, which it added that as a new file. And then
                  you'll also notice babel. config shows up here. We're now getting different formatting, we've got
                  commas at the end of our lines. Our package. json changed because we have ESLint config for Airbnb.
                  Our app vue changed slightly, why? Probably more configuration. Again, semicolons and commas showing
                  up in different places. So that's what a lot of these code changes are, it's changing the actual
                  formatting of the code. Now once again if you don't like these settings, you could just discard them
                  right like this. And this is a really nice feature because sometimes we plan on something at the
                  beginning of a project, or we add a feature in with vue add, but then we're like, you know what, we
                  want to make a small change to this. And that's where vue invoke really fits in nicely. </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Using the Vue CLI UI for Plugins</h3>
                <p>
                  Sometimes you need a little help finding the different plugins or setting them up and configuring
                  them. I really like the Vue UI for this, so let's take a quick look at that by just typing in vue ui
                  into a terminal. First let's go and open up a project, we'll import the one we just created under vue,
                  and then we called this one vue-plugin-demo. Now if we go look at the puzzle piece over here on the
                  left, that icon means plugins. So here's the plugins that we have in our project. Let's get a little
                  tour of how this works first. You can filter through what you have in your project just by typing in a
                  word, like PWA. If you want to add a new plugin, you can click on these two right here, those are the
                  special cases we mentioned before. So now I can click on vue-router, and then I can click Continue, it
                  will install the router for us. Now before we continue with plugins, if we look over on the left
                  you'll see Dependencies. Now you'll see the vue-router is there. Of course, register-service-worker,
                  effectively this is a much nicer look at your package. json. Going back over to the plugins, you can
                  see our plugins here, and now notice that vue-router is gone at the top, we can now click on Add
                  plugin, and we can search for them. At the time of this recording these were sorted it seems by the
                  most downloaded or used ones, and you can see up here that these are the @vue scoped ones. We've
                  already got Babel and ESLint in our project. And we can scroll through these and look to see what do
                  we want to add. Maybe we wanted vuetify. Well first, we could just type in at the top too. Then we get
                  a little bit of a filtered view. Once we click on that, we can then go to here for more info. It opens
                  up the GitHub repository, or we can install it in the bottom right-hand corner. Now notice that it's
                  asking us information, these are the prompts. Do we want to preset? Default recommended, or do we want
                  to use one of these other options? So, any of the prompts that are there, it'll automatically show up
                  inside these screens. And any file changes that got made will then show up here showing a little git
                  diff, so now we can see that the changes were made to our package. json, and our index. html, and our
                  App. vue. Now we can skip the Git changes. This doesn't mean that we're not going to make the changes
                  to the project, it just means we're not going to commit them right now. Maybe we want to look at our
                  full VS Code editor to do that. So I can click on Skip, and it indeed did pull in vuetify. One last
                  feature that's worth really looking at is the three dots in the upper hand corner. We can update all
                  of our plugins to the latest version by clicking this button right here. So as you can see, the Vue
                  CLI is super powerful, but the Vue UI gives us another look, which might actually make it easier to
                  navigate all the plugins for this ecosystem.

                <h3>Wrap up and What's Next?</h3>
                <p>In this module, we learned how the Vue CLI can help us navigate plugins with Vue applications, and
                  the plugins are the building blocks to creating really rich Vue applications. And we can get plugins
                  right out of the box when we create an application using vue create, or we can add them after the fact
                  with vue add, and we can skip to any prompts we want if there's any prompts supported or presets
                  inside of the plugin by passing those parameters in, and the plugins generator will take care of that
                  for us. If we need to go back and modify an existing application's plugins, we can use vue invoke. And
                  remember, we can always lean on the Vue UI to help us find those plugins and navigate it there as
                  well. In the end, the Vue plugins are going to add dependencies to our application, and possibly
                  reconfigure some of our code, so it's always a good idea to commit our changes to Git first. Now that
                  we've covered plugins, we're going to take a closer look at the Vue UI in the next module. </p></div>

            <div><h2>Creating Vue Apps with
              Vue CLI's UI</h2>
              <div>
                <h3>Overview of the Vue CLI UI</h3>
                <p>You've learned how to interact with the Vue CLI through the terminal commands, but sometimes it's
                  super helpful to be able to use a graphical user interface. This is why the Vue CLI's UI was created.
                  The Vue CLI has a UI. It's a graphical user interface that allows us to create, develop, and manage
                  projects through a UI. It's designed for interacting directly with the Vue CLI. So we can do things
                  through the terminal or we can use the Vue CLI's UI. We've already seen a few glimpses of the Vue
                  CLI's UI throughout this course. In this module, we're going to take a deeper look at the Vue CLI's UI
                  and tour the different features so we can get a feel for how to navigate through the Vue UI. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Touring the Vue CLI UI</h3>
                <p>Let's open up a terminal and we'll run the command vue ui. When we do this, the Vue UI will launch
                  inside your browser, and there we go. First let's start by taking a quick tour of what's available
                  here. And we'll start in the lower right. First we have a button to refresh the plugins API, we can
                  click on that, and when go look at our plugins, that'll actually refresh it. Then right next that, we
                  can do translations. If we click on that, you can see there's information about localization. We can
                  file a bug right next to that. This is really cool because if we find a bug in the UI, it helps you
                  kind of get started in reporting it in a good and constructive way. And then this button right here is
                  for the dark mode to light mode. The default is light mode, like this. I happen to prefer the dark
                  mode, so that's what I use. Now, moving over to the left, we can see Ready on http://localhost:8000.
                  If we click on it, we can see the logs for the program, and we click again and it disappears. Next,
                  right next to that, we see the current working folder. That will be whatever folder you open it up in
                  or are looking at, and then there's a little home icon. This is the Project Manager. If we click on
                  that, you'll see a list of all the projects that you've already opened. Yours might be blank. In that
                  case, you can either create one or import one. And you can also favorite projects here. If we click on
                  the home again, we go back to our dashboard. Right above that, we see three dots. That goes to the Vue
                  Project Manager, same place we just were, and there's an About screen. In the About screen, there's a
                  bunch of useful links and a message from the creator of the Vue UI. And we can go back. And up here
                  are some of the most useful links inside the dashboard. We'll start at the top left, the dashboard
                  itself, that's what we're on. This little puzzle piece is the plugins icon. That lets us go look at
                  the project installed plugins. And we can add plugins to it from up here, and we also have three dots
                  next to that to update the plugins. Then back on the left we've got our dependencies in our project,
                  and then we can install dependencies with a button in the upper right. If we go down again in the
                  icons, we can see the Configuration on the left. That's the configuration for our project. If we click
                  on those, you can see the CLI's configuration or ESLint, whatever happens to be installed in our
                  project. Then the next icon are the Tasks. For the project we have serve, build, and lint. They're
                  almost always going to be there, but you also can see any npm scripts that you have installed in your
                  project. Mine has a few others. If we click on serve and then you can see it can run the task over
                  here. And that's a quick tour of the Vue UI. </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Creating New Projects with the Vue CLI UI</h3>
                <p>Let's learn how to use the Vue UI to create a new project. If we click on the home button in the
                  bottom left, you want to get back to the Vue Project Manager. In the top middle, we're going to click
                  on Create, then we're going to select the folder and we're going to create our project and click the
                  button Create new project here. Now, in the Project folder, we'll type the name of that project. We'll
                  call this vue-hello-ui. We can then change our Package manager if you like, from npm to yarn or back,
                  and my default is npm. And by default, it initializes a Git repository. That's what I want to do. I
                  could put an initial commit message in here. Let's do that now. We'll just call it init-ing, and we
                  hit Next. Now notice it's giving us all these prompts for how do we want to create the project. I
                  could choose default or manual or preset or any preset that I created earlier. Let's choose, in this
                  case, the default preset for babel and eslint. Now, we click Create a Project and it's going to
                  install the plugins and pull down our npm modules and set the whole project up. And that's how we
                  create a new project through the Vue UI. </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Managing Plugins and Dependencies with the Vue CLI UI</h3>
                <p>Now I'm back at our dashboard. Let's take a closer look at how we can configure plugins and
                  dependencies. First, plugins on the left. We'll click on that and we can see that we've got the
                  vue/cli-service, babel, and the eslint plugins. We can add the vue-router or vuex, they're right here
                  up top. For example, let's click on vuex and Continue. And then the Vue UI does its thing where it's
                  going to go out and get vuex and then hook it up to our project. If I want to add a plugin, I can
                  click on the Add plugin and up comes a list of some popular ones. Let's say I wanted the pwa, I can
                  click on that, and then Install in the bottom right hand corner. Once that's complete, we can then
                  choose any configuration there might be, in this case the plugin has no configuration, and then we can
                  finish the installation. Now it's pulling the plugin into the project so we can have our pwa plugin.
                  Once that's complete, some of the files may have changed in the project, so it's showing us those
                  changes, basically doing a git-diff. There were 20 files and we can see what those changes are, and we
                  can commit those changes if we want. This one does a lot of changes because the pwa adds a lot of icon
                  files, as you can see here. It also adds an svg, and if we scroll all the way down, we can start
                  seeing we added a store for vuex. If we want to commit all these changes, we can click this button and
                  then enter a message. We can say adding vuex and pwa. And then we commit them. We could've skipped it
                  as well if we hit the Skip button. Next, let's take a look at the Dependencies over here on the left.
                  It's looking at our package. json to see the main dependencies and the development dependencies right
                  here. We can add new ones by clicking on the upper right-hand corner, Install dependency. And then we
                  can search here for ones we might want. Let's say we wanted axios. We could click on it there or we
                  could choose it as a development dependency right there. Let's choose it as a main dependency, we'll
                  click on axios, and then at the bottom of the screen, we can see Install, we'll click on that, and now
                  it's pulling in axios into our projects so we can make HTTP calls with our new application. One last
                  thing to look at the for dependencies and plugins, notice that it shows us the version that we've
                  pulled in right here. It also shows you next to that the version that was wanted and the latest
                  version that happens to be out. Of course, these are all the same because we just installed them.
                  Let's look at the plugins. We're seeing that it's the same case here too. If I go look at an older
                  project, and if you pull down the vue heroes project, you might have this case as well, depending upon
                  when you installed the dependencies. I'm going to click on the Project Manager in the bottom left-hand
                  corner, and I'm going to open up my vue heroes project. Then I'm going to go look at the plugins.
                  Those look like they're up to date, let's look at the dependencies now and notice that it's analyzing
                  them and seeing that some of them are slightly out of date. Now, look on the far right. Over here, we
                  can see some buttons. That will update those dependencies. So I could do them one at a time. I could
                  also delete the dependencies if I want to, which I don't in this case, or I can click in the upper
                  right-hand corner and update all the dependencies at once. Let's do that now. And once it's done
                  installing and updating the npm dependencies, it'll let us know, and notice now our versions are the
                  same as what's wanted. This is how we can manage and maintain our plugins and dependencies through the
                  Vue UI. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Configuring Projects with the Vue CLI UI</h3>
                <p>Let's go back into the project we created earlier, we'll click on the bottom left-hand corner to
                  Project Manager, we'll get a little practice navigating. And then we should have one down here called
                  vue-hello-ui, let's click on that. Now it's loaded. How do we know which one's loaded? It's the one on
                  the bottom left corner where it tells us the path of the current working folder. Now, sometimes we
                  want to be able to update our project configuration. If we click on the little gear icon in the
                  left-hand side, we can view the configuration for our project. Notice we have three set up. First, the
                  Vue CLI itself. If we wanted to change, for example, where the output directory was going to, we could
                  change it right here. Where it says dist, we could put what we want in there. We can also click on the
                  ESLint configuration. We have the default set up and Lint on save. We can toggle Lint on save off or
                  back on, save the changes. We can also put in strongly recommended or recommended if we want. And if
                  we'd like to, we can go and look at all the individual rules. I'm going to cancel these changes, but
                  you can save them if you like. There are some other options here like opening up the eslintrc file in
                  the upper right-hand corner. Next, we can take a look at the PWA because we added that previously. So
                  here, we can set up all the different options for PWA, like our theme color. We can scroll down for
                  all the options that might be there. Some of the configurations also have more info, which will then
                  open up into GitHub information about the configuration for that CLI plugin. Now the more things that
                  you add to your application, the more configuration you have might have. So this list on the left will
                  vary. One last thing about PWA, notice there's something specific for about opening up the manifest in
                  the upper right-hand corner. We can click on that or if you go back to ESLint, remember what used to
                  be there for that one was opening eslintrc. So this is how you can open up and edit your configuration
                  using the UI. </p></div>
              <div>
                <h3>Running Tasks with the Vue CLI UI</h3>
                <p>Perhaps the coolest part of the Vue UI is that we can run the tasks. So let's click on the clipboard
                  on the left-hand side, and by default we can see these tasks are in our project. Now if we do serve,
                  we can see all the different options here. First, the easiest thing to do is just run the task. So
                  we'll run this task, it'll compile and build the application, and then when it's done, we'll see that
                  the build was successful. So if we wanted to see the app, we can open it up by clicking on Open app
                  right here. It'll launch it into another tab. We'll go back to the Vue UI, and notice that by default
                  it's going to the dashboard. We can see our success, errors, and warnings, our assets, modules, and
                  dependencies, how long it took to build it, different speed stats, information about all the assets in
                  our project and the dependencies that are there. If we scroll back up, we can toggle between the
                  parsed, the stats, and Gzip. Gzip's the way we probably want to put it onto a production server.
                  Looking at the other options here, the output shows us what happened while building it. So if we
                  edited our project, we'd see more output here. We can clear our output by clicking on the trashcan.
                  And if we click on the Analyzer button, we can see a deeper analysis of what's inside of our bundles.
                  Here are the three sizes for stats, parsed, and Gzip. If you hover over the different pieces, you'll
                  see the different pieces that are taking up more or less of the space. Finally, we can stop our task
                  by clicking there. Now if we had any parameters, we can go ahead and put them into our parameters
                  list. Perhaps we want to open a browser on start. And you'll recognize these parameters are the same
                  ones that you can run from the terminal with the Vue CLI. Next, let's take a look at the build. Now,
                  let's go ahead and just run the build so it gets going, and this is going to do it for production by
                  default. So notice it's already taking longer than it did to do serve. Instead of being 2 seconds, it
                  was 4. And our sizes are smaller. And you get some of the same stats down below, and then our assets,
                  of course. If we look at the output, we'll see the output of the different files, and then if you look
                  at the Analyzer, we can see what's in our bundles. Notice there's less files and less things to look
                  at here because this is a production build. If we click on the Parameters, we'll see the parameters
                  for building. Next, we can take a look at the lint, and this one has less options, we can run the
                  task. It didn't find any issues, we can click on the Parameters. And there's also other tasks that we
                  can be running. Any time you have npm scripts in your package. json, they'll be listed here as well.
                  If we added end-to-end testing or unit testing, those would also show up here as tasks. What I find
                  most intriguing is sometimes you really need to look at the build to see what's inside those bundles,
                  so I really like how the Analyzer shows us the bundles right here. It becomes super helpful when
                  you're trying to figure out why your bundles are too large, in some cases, so you can start trimming
                  out pieces or maybe refactoring to make it be a little more efficient. And this is how we use the
                  tasks with the Vue CLI's UI. </p>

                <h3>Summary of the Vue CLI UI</h3>
                <p>In this module, we walked through the different features of the Vue CLI's UI, a graphical user
                  interface that we can use to do a whole bunch of things with our applications using the Vue CLI. We
                  explored the Project Manager and how we can import projects, create new ones or tag favorites. We can
                  manage our plugins or dependencies. We can configure our project or our plugins. We can even go to
                  light mode or dark mode, depending upon how you like to look at the app, and one of my favorite
                  features are the tasks because we can serve, build, lint or run any npm script right from inside the
                  UI, and then after a build, we can even analyze the contents of our bundles. We learned about the Vue
                  CLI's UI last because I find it to be important to understand what the different commands in the CLI
                  are through the terminal first. And now that you've learned how to use these commands through the
                  terminal and through the UI, you can make the decision yourself on which way to run them under what
                  circumstances. My name is John Papa, and it's been a pleasure sharing with you this course, Developing
                  Faster with the Vue CLI. Thanks for watching, and go have a lot of fun building great applications
                  with Vue. </p></div>
