        <h3>124 - Introduction</h3>
        <p>Back to our vidly application. So far we have built these API endpoints so we can
          manage:</p>
        <figure>
        <pre><code class="language-command">/api/genres
/api/movies
/api/customers
/api/rentals</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-001</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Nearly all applications out there require some sort of authentication and authorization.
          So in this section, we're going to take this application to the next level and implement
          authentication and authorization.</p>
        <p>Now before we go any further, I want to make sure we are on the same page.</p>
        <p>So authentication is the process of identifying if the user is who they claim they are -
          that's when we login. So we send our username and password to the server, and the server
          authenticates us.</p>
        <p>Authorization, is determining if the user has the right permission to perform the given
          operation.</p>
        <p>So in our vidly application, we want to make sure that only authenticated users or logged
          in users can perform operations that modify data. If the user is anonymous - if they are
          not logged in they they can only read data from the endpoints.</p>
        <p>If they want to create a new genre or update a movie, they have to be authenticated
          first. As an additional security, we want to make sure that only admin users can delete
          data. So that's a second level of authorization - we're talking about permissions
          here.</p>
        <p>These are the requirements we are going to implement in this section. To do this, we are
          going to add two new endpoints to our application.</p>
        <p>First, we should be able to register users.</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-command">// Register: POST /api/users</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-002</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Because we POST we create a new resource, in this case a new user.</p>
        <p>We should also be able to login a user - that's used for authentication. Now here's a
          question for you. What http method, should we use to implement login? With login we are
          not creating a new resource, not updating or removing an existing one, so how can we
          implement this in RESTful terms? This is a scenario which you may encounter frequently in
          real-world applications. Sometimes the operation you're dealing with doesn't have that
          Create/Read/Update/Delete semantic. The way we model this is RESTful terms is by referring
          to this as a request or command.</p>
        <p>So we are creating a new login request or command so we use POST</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-command">// Login: POST /api/logins</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-003</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In your application, you may want to store all the logins into the applications in a
          separate collection in MongoDB. So, in that context using POST makes perfect sense here.
          Even if you don't store individual logins and you just want to validate the username and
          password you can still treat this resource as login resource and use post to create
          it.</p>
        <p>Here's an exercise for you. I want you to implement this API:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-command">// Register: POST /api/users</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-004</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>to register new users. For each user we want the following properties:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>name</li>
          <li>email</li>
          <li>password</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Also, when defining your schema, for the email property in the Schema type object, set
          the unique property to true. So when we define the Schema we set the type of email to a
          Schema type object:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">email: {
  type: String,
  unique: true
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-004</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This will ensure that we do not store two documents with the same email in MongoDB.</p>
        <h3>125 - Creating the User Model</h3>
        <p>First I am going to define a new User model. In the models folder add a new file called
          user.js</p>
        <p>To save time we can copy a lot of the code from genre.js:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const Joi = require('joi');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const genreSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    minlength: 5,
    maxlength: 50
  }
});

const Genre = mongoose.model('Genre', genreSchema);

function validateGenre(genre) {
  const schema = {
    name: Joi.string().min(3).required()
  };

  return Joi.validate(genre, schema);
}

exports.genreSchema = genreSchema;
exports.Genre = Genre;
exports.validate = validateGenre;</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-005</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So, at the top, we have this Schema. We will define this while calling the model method.
          There is really no need, in this case, to define this as a separate constant:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const Genre = mongoose.model('Genre',
  new mongoose.Schema({
    name: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
      minlength: 5,
      maxlength: 50
  }
}));</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-006</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Modify the model and collection name to User:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const User = mongoose.model('User', new mongoose.Schema({</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-007</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The name property is a required string that has to be between 5 and 50 characters. That
          sounds good to me. Next, let's add email:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">email: {
  type: String,
  required: true,
  minlength: 5,
  maxlength: 255,
  unique: true
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-008</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>We increase the maximum length and also, as discussed in the last lecture, we should add
          the unique property to make sure we don't store two users with the same email in
          MongoDB.</p>
        <p>The last property is password:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">password: {
  type: String,
  required: true,
  minlength: 5,
  maxlength: 1024
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-009</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We set the max length to higher value because this password will be hashed. We don't need
          the unique property.</p>
        <p>Next is our validate function:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function validateUser(user) {
  const schema = {
    name: Joi.string().min(5).max(50).required(),
    email: Joi.string().min(5).max(255).required().email(),
    password: Joi.string().min(5).max(255).required()
  };</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-010</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>First, we rename to validateUser. We specify name, which is between 5-50 characters and
          required. We have email, which should be between 5-255 characters and required. Here, we
          also call the email method to make sure the email is valid. Finally we have password which
          is also a string between 5 and 255. This is the password that the user sends in plain
          text. We are going to hash this which will result in a longer string - that's the string
          we will store in MongoDB.</p>
        <p>Finally we need to change the call to Joi.validate from genre to user:</[>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">return Joi.validate(user, schema);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-011</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>So we are done with our validate user function, now we need to export our user model. We
          can delete our first exports statement - that's for our schema:</p>
        <figure>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">exports.User = User;
exports.validate = validateUser;</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-012</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So we are done with our User model. In the next section we will add a route to register
          new users.</p>
        <h3>126 - Registering Users</h3>
        <p>Alright, now we are going to create a new route to register new users. In the routes
          folder add a new file, users.js. Once again, to save time, I'm going to go to genres.js
          and copy the require statements and the new routes into our users.js module:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const {Genre, validate} = require('../models/genre');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', async (req, res) =&gt; {
  const genres = await Genre.find().sort('name');
  res.send(genres);
});</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-013</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Now let's make some changes. On the top we need to import the user model instead of the
          Genre model:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code
            class="language-javascript">const {User, validate} = require('../models/user');</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-014</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So, for models/user, we import the user class as well as the validate function. We also
          require mongoose, express and router.</p>
        <p>Next we add our new route which is post:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code
            class="language-javascript">router.post('/', async (req, res) =&gt; {</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-015</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>For creating, registering new users, and finally we need to export this router:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">module.exports = router;</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-016</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Now, in index.js, we need to tell express that for any route that starts with /api/users
          it should use the router we just exported above.</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code
            class="language-javascript">const users = require('./routes/users');</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-017</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Then we tell express to use this route:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">app.use('/api/users', users);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-018</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So, we have built the big picture. Now let's go back to our users module and implement
          this new route:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code
            class="language-javascript">router.post('/', async (req, res) =&gt; { });</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-019</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So, here we need to validate the request. If it's not valid we have to return a 400
          error, which is bad request, otherwise we're going to create a new use object and save it
          to the database.</p>
        <p>We can borrow some more code from our genres module. Copy the body of the post method
          onto the users post method and make the following adjustments:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">router.post('/', async (req, res) =&gt; {
  const { error } = validate(req.body);
  if (error) return res.status(400).send(error.details[0].message);

  let user = await User.findOne({ email: req.body.email });
  if (user) return res.status(400).send('User already registered.');

  user = new User({
    name: req.body.name,
    email: req.body.email,
    password: req.body.password
  });

  user = await user.save();

  res.send(user);
});</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-020</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>We add some validation to make sure the user is not already registered. We use findOne
          instead of findById because we are not looking a user up by their id we are looking them
          up by one of their properties - email:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">let user = await User.findOne({ email: req.body.email });</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-021</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This returns a promise which we await and assign to a user object. We define a variable
          instead of a constant because later we will reset this.</p>
        <p>In this scenario if the user already exists in the database we return a 400 bad request
          to the client:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">if (user) return status(400).send('User already registered.');</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-022</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Ok so if we have a valid user object that is not registered in the database then we save
          this user in the database.</p>
        <p>First we reset the user object (at this point it should be null):</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">user = new User({
  name: req.body.name,
  email: req.body.email,
  password: req.body.password
});</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-023</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>And then we save the user and return it to the client:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code
            class="language-javascript">user = await user.save(); res.send(user);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-024</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Test the application. In postman send a post request to:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-command">http://localhost:3000/api/users</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-024</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In the body of the request set the raw property and type to Json (application/json)
          object and then pass three properties:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig10-025.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-025</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So in this request I am sending an invalid email and we are not passing a password.</p>
        <p>You should receive the following response:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig10-026.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-026</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So change the email to:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig10-027.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-027</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>You should receive the following response:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig10-028.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-028</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So, now, let's change the email to:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig10-029.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-029</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>And now you should receive the following message:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig10-030.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-030</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Finally let's add a password that is 5 characters long:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig10-031.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-031</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>At last you should get a 200 response and the user object that has been stored in the
          database should be returned to you:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig10-032.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-032</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>When registering a new user it isn't ideal that we are returning their password in the
          response above to the client. We will look at that in the next lecture.</p>

        <p>If we post again with the same values we should receive the following error message
          (along with 400 bad request):</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig10-033.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-033</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>127 - Using Lodash</h3>
        <p>So, back in our post method, we want to modify the response to our client. So there are
          two options here. One approach is to send a custom object like this:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">res.send({
  name: user.name,
  email: user.email
});</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-034</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This way we can exclude the password and the version properties. This approach is
          perfectly fine but in this lecture we will introduce you to a useful library that gives
          you alot of utility functions for working with objects. If you are an experienced
          JavaScript developer you'll probably know what I'm talking about - lodash. This is the
          second option.</p>
        <p>lo-dash is basically the optimized version of underscore. Underscore has been around for
          a long time and has a lot of utility functions for working with objects, strings, arrays
          and so on.</p>
        <p>If you look in the documentation, you can see all the utility function that we have for
          working with arrays, numbers, strings, objects and so on. So lodash is extremely powerful
          and in this lecture we will look at how to use it in your Node applications.</p>
        <p>Install lodash</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-command">npm i lodash</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-035</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So in the users module we need to install lodash:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const _ = require('lodash');</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-035</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>By convention we assign this to a constant called _ because it is short and clean. The
          underscore object has a utility method called pick:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">_.pick(user, ['name', 'email']);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-036</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We pass the pick method an object, user, and then pass an array of properties in the that
          object that we want to pick. This will return a new object with only those properties.</p>
        <p>Instead of manually repeating user. when we send the response:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code
            class="language-javascript">res.send({ name: user.name, email: user.email });</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-037</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We can use the pick method:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code
            class="language-javascript">res.send( _.pick(user, ['id', ''name', 'email']) );</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-038</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We have also included the id property in the example above. We can also modify the code
          when setting up the new user object.</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">user = new User( _.pick(req.body, ['name', 'email', 'password']));</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-039</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Now here we might 50 properties. A malicious user may send us properties to be stored in
          the database. We only want to hand pick a few of these so in the example above we specify
          name, email and password.</p>
        <p>So we create the user, save it, then return it to the client.</p>
        <p>Test the application in postman. Send a new post request to the server and you should see
          the following object in the response:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig10-040.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-040</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Which contains only id, name and email. Now in all these requests so far we have sent
          really simple passwords. If you want to enforce password complexity there is an npm
          package built on top of Joi called Joi password complexity.</p>
        <p>You can use this library to configure an object that determins the password complexity in
          your application:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const complexityOptions = {
  min: 10,
  max: 30,
  lowerCase: 1,
  upperCase: 1,
  numeric: 1,
  symbol: 1,
  requirementCount: 2,
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-041</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>As it stands our new api endpoint is storing passwords in plain text which is very bad.
          This will be addressed in the next lecture where we will examine password hashing</p>
        <h3>128 - Hashing Passwords</h3>
        <p>In this lecture we will look at how to hash passwords using a very popular library called
          bcrypt:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-command">npm i bcrypt</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-042</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Create a playground file to learn how to use the bcrypt library called hash.js. Load
          bcrypt and store it in a constant:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-043</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>To hash a password we need a salt. What is a salt? Well imagine our password is:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-command">1234</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-035</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>When we hash that let's imagine we get a string like this:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-command">1234 -> abcd</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-036</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The hashing algorithm is one way so if we have abcd we cannot decrypt this and get 1234.
          From a security point of view that is great. If a hacker looks at out database he or she
          cannot decrypt these hashed passwords. However they can compile a list of popular
          passwords and hash them. They can then look at the database of our application, find the
          hashed password, and then they know that abcd represents 1234. So that's why we need a
          salt.</p>
        <p>A salt is basically a random string that is added before or after this password, so the
          resulting hash password will be different each time based on the salt used. Let's see this
          in action:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">bcrypt.genSalt();</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-037</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Note that this method has two version. The first one is asynchronous, the second one is
          synchronous. As a best practice you should always use asynchronous methods because as I
          told you at the beginning of the course in Node applications we have a single thread. We
          don't want to keep that thread busy because then we can't server other clients.</p>
        <p>So we call genSalt and as an argument we pass the number of rounds that we want to run
          the algorithm to generate the salt. The higher the number, the longer it's going to take
          to generate the salt. Also, the salt will be more complex and harder to break. So the
          default value is 10 we'll use that.</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">bcrypt.genSalt(10);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-038</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Because this is an asynchronous method, we can either pass a callback here, and that's
          what you see in the official documentation as well as a lot of tutorial videos on the web.
          But this method also has an overload that returns a promise. So, instead of passing a
          callback we get a promise, await it and then get the salt:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-039</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Now we need to wrap this in an async function like run:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">async function run() {
  const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);
  console.log(salt);
}

run();</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-040</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We log the salt to the console and finally we call the run function. Run the
          application:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig10-041.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-041</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So this is an example of a Salt. We can see the number of rounds we use included in the
          salt (10)</p>
        <p>So here we have a long random string that is included as part of hashing our password.
          With this, every time we hash our password with a new salt, we get a different result.</p>
        <p>Now that we have a salt we can hash our password:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code
            class="language-javascript">const hashed = await bcrypt.hash('1234', salt);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-042</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We use the hash method of the bcrypt object, we pass the password 1234 through as the
          first argument, the second argument is our salt. You can pass a callback through as the
          third argument but we are not going to use this. Instead we are going to get the promise
          that is returned.</p>
        <p>So we await the promise and get the hashed password. So now, let's log this on the
          console as well:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(hashed);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-043</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Run the application:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig10-044.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-044</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>On the first line we have our salt, on the second line we can see the salt as well - so
          the salt is included in the hashed password. The reason this is included is that later
          when we want to authenticate the user we want to validate their username and password. So
          there the user sends the password in plain text, we need to hash it again, but we need to
          have the original salt that was used to generate this hash. So during comparing the plain
          text password, with the hashed password, bcrypt needs to know the original salt that was
          used to hash the password.</p>
        <p>So now we know how bcrypt works let's put these two lines in our post route handler:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);
user.password = await bcrypt.hash(user.password, salt);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-045</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Instead of 1234 we use user.password - the plain text password. So we hash it with the
          salt then reset it by assigning to it. Finally we save the user to the database:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">await user.save();</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-046</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We also need to import bcrypt:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-047</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In Compass delete the users collection because all the user documents so far contain
          plain text passwords. Run the application and send a new post request in postman:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig10-048.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-048</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So here we have a new user. Refresh the list in compass and you should see the new user
          with a hashed password:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig10-049.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-049</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So we have now implemented the register new user endpoint.</p>
        <h3>129 Authenticating Users</h3>
        <p>In the routes folder add a new file called auth.js. Copy and paste all the code from
          users.js to auth.js.</p>
        <p>Go to index.js and import the module:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const auth = require('./routes/auth');</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-050</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We tell express to use the new route:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">app.use('/api/auth', auth);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-051</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So, if we have any requests for the /api/auth endpoint or any of it's child endpoints we
          are going to delegate this to the auth router.</p>
        <p>Now, back in the auth module on the top, first we have to validate the body of the
          request. But the validate function we have here:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const { error } = validate(req.body);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-052</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This is the one that we imported from our user module:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code
            class="language-javascript">const {User, validate} = require('../models/user');</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-053</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So this is validating that in the body of the request we have three properties: - name -
          email - password</p>
        <p>In a real world application you might have other properties as part of registering a
          user. This validate function is for validating a new user, it's not for validating the
          email and password that we expect at this endpoint. So here we need a different validate
          function. So we remove the validate function that we were importing:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code
            class="language-javascript">const {User} = require('../models/user');</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-054</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>And define a separate validate function in the auth module. Again, to save time, we can
          copy our validate function from the user module to the auth module and modify it:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function validate(req) {
  const schema = {
    email: Joi.string().min(5).max(255).required().email(),
    password: Joi.string().min(5).max(255).required() };

    return Joi.validate(req, schema);
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-055</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We renamed the function to validate and changed the parameter to req. For this schema
          object we need only two properties - email and password so we also deleted the name.</p>
        <p>Now, back in our route handler, this is our first validation:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const { error } = validate(req.body);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-056</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Next we need to make sure that we do have a user with a given email so we load the
          user:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">let user = await User.findOne({ email: req.body.email });</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-057</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>If we don't have the user(we add a NOT ! to the expression) we should return a 400 bad
          request and send a message - "Invalid email or password".</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">if (!user) return res.status(400).send('Invalid email or password.');</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-058</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Note that we don't send a error 404, which means not found, because we don't want to tell
          the client why the authentication failed. We don't want to tell if the email is incorrect
          or the password - so we don't want to say "We dont have a user with the given email". We
          just tell the client that this is a bad request, it doesn't have the right data to be
          processed. So this is for validating the username or email. Next we need to validate the
          password. For that we need to use bcrypt.</p>
        <p>So let's delete all this code here:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">user = new User(_.pick(req.body, ['name', 'email', 'password']));
const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);
user.password = await bcrypt.hash(user.password, salt);
await user.save();</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-059</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>and add a call to the compare method of the bcrypt object:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const validPassword = await bcrypt.compare(req.body.password, user.password);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-060</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We use the compare method to compare the plain text password with our hashed password.
          Our plain text password is in req.body.password and our hash password is in user.password.
          As you saw earlier the hash password does include the salt. So when we call the compare
          method bcrypt is going to get that salt and use it to rehash this plain text password. If
          they are equal then this will return true. We await the promise and store the result in
          validPassword.
        </p>
        <p>If the password is not valid:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">if(!validPassword) return res.status(400).send('Invalid email or password.');</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-061</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We return a 400 error with the deliberately vague message.</p>
        <p>Finally, if we get to this point, then we have a valid login. So for now, I just want to
          send a simple true value to the client:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">res.send(true);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-062</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>130 - Testing the Authentication</h3>
        <p>So, for now, let's test this new endpoint back in Postman. We can modify the request we
          had for creating new users. So to save time we can save it as let's say Register User and
          Create a new collection to put it in called Vidly. In the future we can use Register User
          instead of opening a new tab, fill out the details and so on.</p>
        <p>Open a new tab and create a post request to test our authentication endpoint:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-command">http://localhost:3000/api/auth</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-063</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In the body of the request we are going to send a Json object:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig10-064.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-064</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>If your application hangs it might be that we forgot to import Joi at the top of our auth
          module:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const Joi = require('joi');</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-065</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Send the request again you get a status 200 with a response of true:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig10-066.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-066</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>If we change the password to an invalid value:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig10-067.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-067</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Send the request and you get a status 400 Bad Request with a message of "Invalid email or
          password":</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig10-068.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-068</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>If we send a valid password but change the email so that it is invalid again we get a
          status 400 Bad Request with the same generic message.</p>
        <h3>131 - Json Web Tokens</h3>
        <p>So we now have an endpoint for authenticating users. Now we need to modify the response
          that we return so that instead of returning a true value we return a JSon web token. A
          Json web token is basically a long string that identifies a user. As a metaphor you can
          think of it as you drivers license or your passport.</p>
        <p>So when the user logs in on the server we generate the Json web token:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig10-069.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-069</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We give it to the client and then tell them - hey next time you want to come back here
          and call one of our API endpoints you need to show your passport, you need to show your
          drivers license. So on the client we need to store this Json web token which is a long
          string, so we can send it back to the server for future API calls. Now the client can be a
          web application or a mobile application.</p>
        <p>If it's a web application, e.g. Angular or React you can use local storage. This is
          special storage space that is available in every browser. If you're building a mobile app,
          you have a similar option depending on what platform you use.</p>
        <p>So now, let me show you an example of a Json web token. Head over to <a href="jwt.io">jwt.io</a>.
          On this website we have a debugger for working with Json web tokens:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig10-070.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-070</figcaption>
        </figure>
        fig xx-xx
        <p>In the encoded section you can see a real example of a Json web token. The long string
          that you see in the encoded section represents a Json object. When this is decoded we will
          get a Json object. You can see that this string has three parts - each part is color
          coded.</p>
        <p>The first part is red, the second purple and the third blue. On the right side you can
          see the string decoded. The red part is the header of the Json web token. In this header
          we have two properties. One is alg which is short for algorithm, that determines the
          algorithm used for encoding this token. The other is type which has a value of JWT - Json
          Web Token. We never have to worry about this header it's just a standard. What matters to
          us is the second part - the Payload which is the purple part.</p>
        <p>So here we have a Json object with three properties:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>sub is like a user id</li>
          <li>name</li>
          <li>admin</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now the payload that you see:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;sub&quot;: &quot;1234567890&quot;,
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Mosh Hamedani&quot;,
  &quot;admin&quot;: true
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-071</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>is different from the payload I have here, because I modified the Json web token that is
          on this website. So I generated a custom web token and put it here. What I want to point
          out here is that this payload:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;sub&quot;: &quot;1234567890&quot;,
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Mosh Hamedani&quot;,
  &quot;admin&quot;: true
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-072</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>include public properties about the user just like on your passport you have some
          properties about yourself like your name, dob, place of birth etc. We have the same exact
          concept in a Json web token. We can include a few basic public properties about a user and
          with this every time we send a token from the client to the server we can easily extract
          the user id from the payload.</p>
        <p>If we need to know the name of the user then we can simply extract that as well. We don't
          have to query the database, send the id to get a user object and then extract the name
          property.</p>
        <p>By the same token, if you want to know if the user is an admin user or not you can
          include that here:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;sub&quot;: &quot;1234567890&quot;,
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Mosh Hamedani&quot;,
  &quot;admin&quot;: true
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-073</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Again we don't have to send an extra query to the database, to see if the user with the
          given id is admin or not.</p>
        <p>You might be concerned about this approach from a security point of view, because you may
          think that anyone can simply set this admin property for themselves to true and then they
          will be treated as admin on the server. That's not how Json web tokens work.</p>
        <p>The third part of this Json Web Token, in blue, is a digital signature. This digital
          signature is created based on the content of the Json web token along with the secret or
          private key. This secret or private key is only available on the server.</p>
        <p>So if a malicious user gets the Json web token and modifies the admin property the
          digital signature will be invalid because the content of the Json web token is modified.
          Now we need a new digital signature but the hacker cannot generate this digital signature
          because they will need the private key, which is only available on the server. If they
          don't have access to the server they cannot create a valid digital signature, and when
          they send this new tampered Json Web Token to the server it will be declined. The server
          will say this is not a valid Json Web Token.</p>
        <p>So this is how Json Web Tokens work.</p>
        <h3>132 - Generating Authentication Tokens</h3>
        <p>If you look at the libraries on the jwt.io website you can see we have various libraries
          for working with Json Web Tokens for different platforms - .Net, Python, Node, etc.</p>
        <p>Back in the terminal install jsonwebtoken:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-command">npm i jsonwebtoken</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-074</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In the auth module, before return the response we need to create a new Json Web Token.
          First we need to import the jsonwebtoken module:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-075</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Now, back in our route handler, we call the sign method of the jwt object:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const token = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id}, 'jwtPrivateKey');</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-076</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The first argument is a payload which can be a simple string or an object. The properties
          we add to the object are entirely up to us. So in our application for now, I want the
          payload of our Json web tokens be an object with only one property: _id.</p>
        <p>The second argument is a secret or private key. This private key is used to create the
          digital signature. For now we hard code the private key. You would not do this in a real
          world application, you should not store your secrets in your source code. Later we're
          going to extract this and put it in an environment variable. You can use any string here -
          it doesn't have to be jwtPrivateKey.</p>
        <p>As a result of calling the sign method we will get a token which we store in a constant
          called token.</p>
        <p>Finally we return this token to the client:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">res.send(token);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-077</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>To test this send a post request with a valid email and password from Postman to our
          authentication endpoint. You should receive a response containing a Json web token:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig10-078.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-078</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Copy this and then in jwt.io in the debugger paste it in:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig10-079.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 10-079</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So now you can see the payload of our Json web token. We have our _id property which we
          set (that's the object id for a MongoDB document). You also have iat, which is the time
          the token was created. We can use this to determine the age of a JWT.</p>
        <h3>133 - Storing Secrets in Environment Variables</h3>
        <p>Earlier in the course, when I was talking about express advanced topics, I introduced you
          to Node package called config. We use this package to store the configuration files of our
          application in Json files or environment variables.</p>
        <p>In this lecture we are going to take this private key out:</p>
        <figure>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">const token = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id}, 'jwtPrivateKey');</code></pre>
        <figcaption>Fig 10-080</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>and store it in an environment variable because, as I told you before, you should never
          store secrets in your code base. Otherwise these secrets are visible to anyone who as
          access to your source code. So, back in the terminal, let's install the config module:</p>
        <figure>
        <pre><code class="language-command">npm i config</code></pre>
        <figcaption>Fig 10-081</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Back in the code create a new folder called config and in that folder create a file
          called default.json to store the default configuration.</p>
        <p>Add the following simple Json object to this file:</p>
        <figure>
        <pre><code class="language-json">{ &quot;jwtPrivateKey&quot;: &quot;&quot; }</code></pre>
        <figcaption>Fig 10-082</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We just add one setting. We set this to an empty string, we don't specify the actual
          value. Here we're just defining a template for all the settings in our application.</p>
        <p>Create another file in the config folder called custom-environment-variables.json So, as
          we discussed before, in this file we specify the mapping between our application settings
          and our environment variables. So copy the Json object from default.json into
          custom-environment-variables.json. We also map the setting to an environment variable
          called jwtPrivateKey:</p>
        <figure>
        <pre><code class="language-json">{ &quot;jwtPrivateKey&quot;: &quot;vidly_jwtPrivateKey&quot; }</code></pre>
        <figcaption>Fig 10-083</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>As a best practice, as discussed before, it is better to prefix this with an application
          name so you don't end up one application setting overwriting another application setting.
          So we use vidly_jwtPrivateKey.</p>
        <p>Go back to auth.js module where we are currently referencing the secret:</p>
        <figure>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">const token = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id}, 'jwtPrivateKey');</code></pre>
        <figcaption>Fig 10-084</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We are gong to replace this with a call to config.get method:</p>
        <figure>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">const config = require('config');</code></pre>
        <figcaption>Fig 10-085</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Back in the post method we call config.get and pasw the name of our application
          setting:</p>
        <figure>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">const token = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id}, config.get('jwtPrivateKey'));</code></pre>
        <figcaption>Fig 10-086</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>That is not a secret it's the name of our application setting. The actual value or secret
          will be in an environment variable.</p>
        <p>One last change, in index.js. When the application starts we want to make sure that this
          environment variable is set. Otherwise we need to terminate the application because our
          authentication endpoint cannot function properly</p>
        <p>So, at the top of the file, we load the config module</p>
        <figure>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">const config = require('config');</code></pre>
        <figcaption>Fig 10-087</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We use the config.get method again:</p>
<figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">if(!config.get('jwtPrivateKey')) {
  console.error('FATAL ERROR: jwtPrivateKey is not defined.');
  process.exit(1);
}</code></pre>
<figcaption>Fig 10-088</figcaption>
</figure>
        <p>If the environment variable is not defined we log a fatal error and then exit the
          process. Earlier you learned about the process object. This is one of the global objects
          in Node. Here we have a method called exit to which we supply a code. 0 indicates success.
          Anything but 0 indicates failure. Often we use exit(1) if you want to exit the process in
          case of an error.</p>
        <p>So, at this point, we have not set the environment variable. Let's run the application
          and see what happens:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="./images/Fig10-089.png"/>
  <figcaption>Fig 10-089</figcaption>
</figure>
        <p>You might think the application is still running because nodemon has not terminated. But
          if you go to Postman and send an http request to the application, you will see our
          application is not responding.</p>
        <p>If the application crashes nodemon continues to run. To demonstrate use node to run the
          application instead:</p>
        <figure>
        <pre><code class="language-command">node index.js</code></pre>
        <figcaption>Fig 10-090</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>You receive the same error:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="./images/Fig10-091.PNG"/>
  <figcaption>Fig 10-091</figcaption>
</figure>
        <p>but node terminates and we are back in the terminal.</p>
      <p>Now let's set the environment variable. As discussed before on Mac you use export on
        Windows you use set.</p>
      <p>I set the environment variable on my Windows Machines to the following:
        <figure>
        <pre><code class="language-command">vidly_jwtPrivateKey myinSecureKey</code></pre>
        <figcaption>Fig 10-092</figcaption>
        </figure></p>
      <p>If you back to postman and send another request to login you should see a valid Json web
        token that is signed with a private key that is stored in an environment variable:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="./images/Fig10-093.PNG"/>
  <figcaption>Fig 10-093</figcaption>

      <p>NOTE - doesn't seem to work from terminal in Visual Studio Code</p>
      <h3>134 - Setting Response Headers</h3>
      <p>So, in the current implementation when the user logs in we generate a Json web token and
        return it in the body of the response. Now let's take this application to the next level.
        Let's imagine when the user registers we want to assume they are logged in, so they don't
        have to login separately.</p>
      <p>Of course this requirement does not apply to every application. Sometimes you want to
        enforce the user to verify their email address, so after this sign off you send them an
        email and they click a link. So the process is different.</p>
      <p>However, in this course, let's imagine that vidly is an application that runs locally in a
        video store. So, people who use this application are people who work in this video store so
        you don't need to verify their email address. So the first day that they join the store,
        they need to create an account and boom they're logged in.</p>
      <p>So let's go to the post method in our users module where we register a new user If you look
        the response we're returning here, we're returning an object with three properties:</p>
<figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">res.send(_.pick(user, ['id', 'name', 'email'])</code></pre>
<figcaption>Fig 10-096</figcaption>
</figure>
      <p>Now, we could add the Json web token as another property here, but that's a bit ugly
        because it's not a property of a user. A better approach is to return the Json web token in
        an http header.</p>
      <p>So just like we have headers in our request we also have headers in our response. So I'm
        going to go back to our Auth module and borrow this line of code:</p>
<figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const token = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id}, config.get('jwtPrivateKey'));</code></pre>
<figcaption>Fig 10-097</figcaption>
</figure>
      <p>for generating the token. Back in the users module before we send the response to the
        client we generate the token then we call response.header:</p>
      <figure>
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">res.header('x-auth-token', token).send(_.pick(user, ['id', 'name', 'email']));</code></pre>
      <figcaption>Fig 10-098</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The first argument is the name of the header. Because we are sending a custom header, we
        set the header prefix to x- and then supply an arbitrary name like auth-token. The second
        argument is our value, which in this case is our token. With this simple change we set the
        header and then send the response to the client.</p>
      <p>On the line above we are using jwt:</p>
<figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const token = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id}, config.get('jwtPrivateKey'));</code></pre>
<figcaption>Fig 10-099</figcaption>
</figure>
      <p>as well as the config module. So we need to import these at the top of our module:</p>
      <figure>
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken'); const config = require('config');</code></pre>
      <figcaption>Fig 10-100</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Now let's test this:</p>
      <figure>
      <pre><code class="language-command">nodemon</code></pre>
      <figcaption>Fig 10-101</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>In Postman find the Register user template and modify the email in the req.body:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./images/Fig10-102.PNG"/>
        <figcaption>Fig 10-102</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Send this and you get the following response as you did before:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./images/Fig10-103.PNG"/>
        <figcaption>Fig 10-103</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Look in the headers tab and you should see a new header:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="./images/Fig10-104.PNG"/>
  <figcaption>Fig 10-104</figcaption>
</figure>
      <p>This is set to our Json token. So in our client app, when we register the user we can read
        this header, we can store this Json web token, on the client, and next time we go to make an
        API call we can send this to the server.</p>
      <h3>135 - Encapsulating Logic in Mongoose Modules</h3>
      <p>Now there is a problem in our current implementation. In the users module this is how we
        generate a Json web token:</p>
      <figure>
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">const token = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id}, config.get('jwtPrivateKey'));</code></pre>
      <figcaption>Fig 10-105</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>We have the exact same code in the auth module:</p>
      <figure>
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">const token = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id}, config.get('jwtPrivateKey'));</code></pre>
      <figcaption>Fig 10-106</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Look at the payload of this Json object - currently we only have the id property. Chances
        are we're going to add another property in this payload - maybe the name of the user, maybe
        their email address, maybe their role, perhaps you want to know if they are an admin user or
        not. With the current implementation every time we want to change this payload we have to go
        to the other module and make the exact same change. In this lecture we will examine how to
        encapsulate this logic in a single place.</p>
      <p>Now, where should we move this logic to? An amateur programmer may think okay, I will
        create a function like this:</p>
<figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function generateAuthenticationToken() {
}</code></pre>
<figcaption>Fig 10-107</figcaption>
</figure>
      <p>Put this function somewhere that we can reuse, maybe in another module, that we can import
        in both auth and user modules, and with this we have the logic in a single place. Well, that
        is true, it works but with this approach you will end up with a lot of functions hanging
        around all over the place.</p>
      <p>In object oriented programming we have a principle called information expert principle.
        That means an object that has enough information and is an expert in a given area should be
        responsible for making decisions and performing tasks.</p>
      <p>As a real world example, think of a chef. A chef has the knowledge of cooking. That's why
        the act of cooking in a restaurant is done by the chef, not by the waiter. The waiter
        doesn't have the right knowledge or information about cooking at a restaurant. So if chef is
        an object then we leave the actual cooking to the chef.</p>
      <p>Take this principle and apply it in this code. So here:</p>
<figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const token = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id}, config.get('jwtPrivateKey'));</code></pre>
<figcaption>Fig 10-108</figcaption>
</figure>
      <p>as part of creating the Json web token, in the payload, we need the id of the user.
        Tomorrow we may need the name of the user or their email. All this information is
        encapsulated where? In the user object. So it's the user object that should be responsible
        for generating the authentication token.</p>
      <p>So the generateAuthenticationToken function we described above should not be hanging
        somewhere in a module, that should be a method in the user object. So we need to add the
        generateAuthenticationToken method to the user object that we load from the database:</p>
<figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const token = user.generateAuthenticationToken();</code></pre>
<figcaption>Fig 10-109</figcaption>
</figure>
      <p>This will give us our token. How can we add this? We need to go back to our user module
        where we defined our user model and make a simple change. So here's our user model:</p>
<figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const User = mongoose.model('User', new mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    minlength: 5,
    maxlength: 50 },
    email: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
      minlength: 5,
      maxlength: 255,
      unique: true },
    password: { type: String, required: true, minlength: 5,
    maxlength: 1024
  }
}));</code></pre>
<figcaption>Fig 10-110</figcaption>
</figure>

      <p>We need to extract the definition of this schema and put it in a separate constant because
        we're going to work with that separately. So extract the schema code from the call to
        mongoose.model:</p>
<figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    minlength: 5,
    maxlength: 50
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    minlength: 5,
    maxlength: 255,
    unique: true },
  password: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    minlength: 5,
    maxlength: 1024
  }
});</code></pre>
<figcaption>Fig 10-111</figcaption>
</figure>
      <p>And now add the following code to create the user model:</p>
      <figure>
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);</code></pre>
      <figcaption>Fig 10-112</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Now we want to add the generateAuthToken method to this schema:</p>
      <figure>
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">userSchema.methods.generateAuthToken = function() {}</code></pre>
      <figcaption>Fig 10-113</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>userSchema.methods returns an object to which you can add additional key value pairs. So we
        add a key: generateAuthToken which we set to a function.</p>
      <p>When we do this, our use object will have a method called generateAuthToken. In this
        function we can have parameters. So if you have a parameter then when calling this method we
        can pass arguments. In this, we don't need any parameters. So, let's cut the logic for
        generating the token from auth.js:</p>
      <figure>
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">const token = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id}, config.get('jwtPrivateKey'));</code></pre>
      <figcaption>Fig 10-114</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>and paste it into our generateAuthToken method in the user module. So in the payload:</p>
      <figure>
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">{ _id: user._id}</code></pre>
      <figcaption>Fig 10-115</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>we need the id of the user. How do we get that? Well, now our generateAuthToken method is
        part of the user object so in order to reference the object itself we replace user with
        this:</p>
      <figure>
      <pre><code class="language-javascript">{ _id: this._id}</code></pre>
      <figcaption>Fig 10-116</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Remember using this means we should use the regular function syntax, you cannot use an
        arrow function:</p>
<figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">userSchema.methods.generateAuthToken = () =&gt; {
  const token = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id}, config.get('jwtPrivateKey'));
}</code></pre>
<figcaption>Fig 10-117</figcaption>
</figure>
      <p>because, as discussed before, arrow functions don't have their own this object. this in an
        arrow function references the calling function.</p>
      <p>Typically we use arrow functions for standalone functions. If you want to create a method
        that is part of an object you should not use an arrow function.</p>
      <p>So we have the token, you can finally return the token:</p>
<figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">userSchema.methods.generateAuthToken = function() {
  const token = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id}, config.get('jwtPrivateKey'));
  return token;
}</code></pre>
<figcaption>Fig 10-118</figcaption>
</figure>
      <p>Back in the auth module we generate the token:</p>
<figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const token = user.generateAuthToken();</code></pre>
<figcaption>Fig 10-119</figcaption>
</figure>
      <p>and send it to the client:</p>
<figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">res.send(token);</code></pre>
<figcaption>Fig 10-120</figcaption>
</figure>
      <p>We need to make the same change in our users module. So delete this line:</p>
        <figure>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">const token = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id }, config.get('jwtPrivateKey')));</code></pre>
        <figcaption>Fig 10-121</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>And replace it with this:</p>
        <figure>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">const token = user.generateAuthToken();</code></pre>
        <figcaption>Fig 10-122</figcaption>
        </figure>
      <p>Remove the require statements for config and jwt from the auth module:</p>
<figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const config = require('config');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');</code></pre>
<figcaption>Fig 10-123</figcaption>
</figure>
      <p>and add them to the top of the user module. Test the application by registering a new user
        in Postman:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./images/Fig10-124.PNG"/>
        <figcaption>Fig 10-124</figcaption>
      </figure>

        <p>and our authentication should be visible in the headers section:</p>

      <h3>136 - Authorization Middleware</h3>

      <p>So at the beginning of this section we decided to protect operations that modify data and
        only make them available to users that have authenticated.</p>

      <p>For example, in genres.js the post endpoint that creates a new genre should only be
        available to authenticated users:</p>

      router.post('/', async (req, res) => { const { error } = validate(req.body); if (error) return
      res.status(400).send(error.details[0].message);

      let genre = new Genre({ name: req.body.name }); genre = await genre.save();

      res.send(genre); });

      <p>We can enforce this with some logic that reads the req header:</p>

      const token = req.header('x-auth-token');

      <p>The request object has a method called header to which we supply the name of the header
        (x-auth-token). We expect a JWT stored in this header so we store it in token.</p>

      <p>Next we validate the token. If the token is valid then we give access to the api endpoint
        otherwise we return a response code 401 (the client doesnt have the authentcation
        credentials to access this resource):</p>

      const token = req.header('x-auth-token'); res.status(401);

      <p>We don't want to repeat this logic in every route handler that needs to modify data. So we
        need to put this logic in a middleware function (which we discussed back in the section
        Express - Advanced Topics)</p>

      <p>So we put this logic in a middleware function and then we can apply that function in route
        handlers that need to modify data.</p>

      <p>First add a new folder called middleware then a file called auth.js</p>

      <p>Add a function to this file called auth which accepts three parameters:</p>

      function auth(req, res, next)

      <p>Next is used to pass control to the next middleware function in the request processing
        pipeline. If this concept feels unfamiliar to you then go back to the section called express
        admin topics, because we explored middleware functions in detail.</p>

      <p>In the body of the function implement logic to attempt to get the token. If we don't have a
        token then we return a 401 response with a message:</p>

      function auth(req, res, next) { const token = req.header('x-auth-token'); if(!token)
      res.status(401).send('Access denied. No token provided'); }

      <p>This helps the client to figure out why they cannot access this resource. If there is a
        token we need to verify that it is valid using JWT module. On the top of the file import
        jsonwebtoken:</p>

      const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

      <p>Next call the verify method passing the token as the first argument and the private key for
        decoding the token as the second:</p>

      const decoded = jwt.verify(token, config.get('jwtPrivateKey'));

      <p>For the above logic to work you will need to import the config module:</p>

      const config = require('config');

      <p>Now we call jwt.verify:</p>

      const decoded = jwt.verify(token, config.get('jwtPrivateKey'));

      <p>As the first argument we pass a token, and as the second argument we pass the private key
        for decoding this token. So, because we store that private key in an environment variable,
        we need to use the config module to read it. Add a require statement for config at the top
        of the file:</p>

      const config = require('config');

      <p>If the supplied token is valid the verify method will return the decoded payload which we
        assign to const called decoded.</p>

      <p>However if the token is not valid the verify method will throw an exception. We can catch
        this exception and return a 400 response - bad request:</p>

      try { const decoded = jwt.verify(token, config.get('jwtPrivateKey')); } catch(ex) {
      res.status(400).send('Invalid token.'); }

      <p>Again, with this error message, we can troubleshoot the authentication issues. So if I'm
        the client I cannot access a given API endpoint, we look at the error message, okay we
        realize we sent an invalid token. Then we look at the logic on the client where we get teh
        token and send it to the server. So this is our catch block.</p>

      <p>Back in the try block we add our decoded payload to our req:</p>

      req.user = decoded;

      <p>We add the user property to our request object and set this to decoded. This is different
        to earlier when we only put the user _id property in the payload:</p>

      userSchema.methods.generateAuthToken = function() { const token = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id},
      config.get('jwtPrivateKey')); return token; }

      <p>So we added a generateAuthToken method to our userSchema. We created a Json web token and
        you can see the payload is just the user id. So when we decode the jwt the object we get
        will just contain the id. We put this in the request ( in auth.js) as a user object.</p>

      req.user = decoded;

      <p>So in our route handlers we can access request.user._id and so on.</p>

      <p>Now in the try block we need to call next() to pass control to the next middleware function
        in the request processing pipeline - in our case that's our route handler so we call
        next:</p>

      next();

      <p>As we discussed before, in middleware functions, we either terminate the request/ response
        life cycle or pass control to the next middleware function.</p>

      <p>There is a small issue with the code. In the case where we don't have a token we send a
        status 401 to the client but we should also make sure that we exit from the function:</p>

      if(!token) return res.status(401).send('Access denied. No token provided');

      <p>The last thing to do is export the auth function:</p>

      module.exports = auth;

      <p>Alternatively we can make this code more concise by exporting the function directly
        instead:</p>

      module.exports = function (req, res, next) {}

      <h3>137 - Protecting Routes</h3>

      <p>So now that we have a middleware function we could either go to index.js where we are
        already applying middleware functions:</p>

      app.use(express.json());

      <p>So could add our middleware function in index.js and then it would be executed before every
        route handler. However, we don't want to do this because not all api endpoints should be
        protected.</p>

      <p>Some of our API endpoints should be public like registering a user or logging in, or
        getting the list of genres or customers. So in this case we want to apply this middleware
        function selectively to certain endpoints.</p>

      <p>So, back to the genres module, here's our post route handler:</p>

      router.post('/', async (req, res) => {

      <p>The first argument is the route, the second is optionally middleware and the third will be
        the actual route handler. So at the top of the genres file let's import the middleware
        function:</p>

      const auth = require('../middleware/auth');

      <p>Now modify the post method to pass auth as a middleware function to be executed before the
        other middleware function which in this case is our route handler:</p>

      router.post('/', auth, async (req, res) => { }

      <p>Now let's test this in Postman by sending a POST request to the genres endpoint (make sure
        you don't send the authentication token in the header):</p>

      http://localhost:3000/api/genres

      <p>You should receive response code 401 Unauthorized and the message:</p>

      Access denied. Not token provided

      <p>Now in the Headers tab of Postman provide an invalid token by entering x-auth-token for the
        key and 1234 for the value.</p>

      <p>You should receive response code 400 Bad Request and the message:</p>

      Invalid token.

      <p>Finally let's supply a valid token (copied from our POST User method that we use to
        register a new user). Also make sure you supply a valid JSon object in the body of the
        request.</p>

      <p>You should receive response code 200 OK and the new JSON genre object in the body of the
        response.</p>

      <p>As an exercise apply this middleware function can now be applied to other middleware
        functions that modify data.</p>

      <h3>138 - Getting the Current User</h3>

      <p>In a lot of applications there are times when we want to get information about the
        currently logged in user.</p>


      <p>So in this lecture we are going to add a new api endpoint to our users.js module for
        getting the current user.</p>

      <p>Currently we only have 1 route handle for creating a new user in the users.js module.</p>

      <p>We need to add another handler for get methods. Now here as the route or the path we can
        pass a parameter:</p>

      router.get('/:id');

      <p>But this means the client should send the id to the server. Whilst this approach is
        perfectly fine there are times, perhaps for security reasons, you dont want to have an
        endpoint like this because then I can send the id of another user and look at their account
        where there may be some information that should not be visible publicly.</p>

      <p>An often used approach to get information about the current user is to have an api endpoint
        like me:</p>

      router.get('/me');

      <p>With this the client is not going to send the user id - it will be obtained from the Json
        Web Token.</p>

      <p>It is not possible to forge someone else's Json Web Token because in order to do so I would
        need to create a new digital signature for that Json Web Token.</p>

      <p>Now let's add the route handler:</p>

      router.get('/me', auth, async (req, res) => { const user = await
      User.findById(req.user._id).select('-password'); res.send(user); });

      <p>The me api endpoint should only be available to authenticated users so we need to import
        the auth middleware:</p>

      const auth = require('../middleware/auth');

      <p>To clarify here auth represents authorization NOT authentication because authentication is
        about validating the username and password. In this case we want to see if the user has
        permission to access a resource or not and that is authorization.</p>

      <p>So the auth middleware will prevent any requests that don't provide a valid Json Web Token
        from executing the code in the route handler. The route handler has access to the req.user
        object which means we can access it's _id property:</p>

      (req.user._id)

      <p>So instead of passing the _id property in the path or route we get it from req.user._id
        which actually comes from our Json Web Token which makes it a more secure approach.</p>

      <p>We call User.findById excluding the password (we don't want to send this back to the
        client):</p>

      const user = await User.findById(req.user._id).select('-password');

      <p>Finally you can send this user object to the client:</p>

      res.send(user);

      <p>Let's test in Postman using GET request:</p>

      http://localhost:3000/api/users/me

      <p>Initially dont specify a JWT and you will receive a 401 Unauthorized response with the
        message:</p>

      Access denied. No token provided.

      <p>Now add a valid JWT (you can get this from Register User) in the header and click send. You
        will receive a 200 OK response and the user account details that match the supplied JWT in
        the body of the response:</p>

      { "_id": "5ad5fd6ed4b65e98dee78835", "name": "Mosh Hamedani", "email": "maxsage@gmail.com",
      "__v": 0 }

      <p>Note the password has been excluded.</p>

      <h3>139 - Logging Out Users</h3>

      <p>In our routes/auth module we defined this route:</p>

      router.post('/', async (req, res) => { }

      <p>For authenticating users. What about logging out users? Do we need a separate route for
        that? No, because we are not storing this token:</p>

      const token = user.generateAuthToken();

      <p>anywhere in the server, so we don't need a separate route handler to delete this token. So
        technically you need to implement the logging out feature on the client not on the
        server.</p>

      <p>So on the client application when the user wants to log out you simply delete that token
        from the client. Now there are courses and tutorials that teach you to store the token on
        the server in the database - this is very bad practice because these tokens are like keys
        that give a client access to protected api endpoints. If a hacker can get access to your
        database they can see all these tokens for authenticated users - they don't even have to
        know the password for a user. They can simply use one of the stored tokens to execute
        requests on the behalf of a user.</p>

      <p>So you should not store tokens in your database. If you really want to store the token in
        the database make sure you encrypt it.</p>

      <p>Storing a token in plain text in the database is like getting the passport or drivers
        licenses of all the users, putting them in a central place, and then anyone malicious or
        otherwise, who has access to the central place can simply get the passport and drivers
        licenses and imitate other clients.</p>

      <p>So, once again, do not store the tokens on the server. Store them on the client. As a
        security best practice, whenever you are sending the token from the client to the server,
        make sure to use https. So a hacker, sitting in the middle, sniffing traffic cannot read the
        token sent from client to the server because the data is encrypted.</p>

      <h3>140 - Role Based Authorization</h3>

      <p>So far we have implemented authentication and authorization successfully. Now let's take
        this application to the next level. Let's imagine certain operations such as deleting data
        can only be performed by admins.</p>

      <p>Let's examine how to implement role based authourization.</p>

      <p>In models/user.js examine the userSchema. Currently we have three properties:</p>

      - name - email - password

      <p>We need to add another property to the userSchema called isAdmin of type Boolean:</p>

      isAdmin: Boolean

      <p>In MongoDB Compass make one of the users an admin by editing a document and adding a field
        after password. Don't forget to change the default type from string to Boolean. So, now we
        have a user that is an admin.</p>

      <p>When they login we need to include the isAdmin property in the JWT payload so next time the
        send this JWT to the server we can extract this property directly from the token. We don't
        have to get the id, go into the database, and see if you're an admin or not. Again, as
        discussed previously, with a digital signature included in a Json web token, a malicious
        user cannot change the value of isAdmin for their user account. If they make any changes,
        they have to regenerate the digital signature - this requires knowing the private key that
        we stored in an environment variable on the server.</p>

      <p>Now back in the user model when we generate the token we want to add our new isAdmin
        property in the payload:</p>

      const token = jwt.sign({ _id: this._id, isAdmin: this.isAdmin }, config.get('jwtPrivateKey'));

      <p>This is the benefit of encapsulating this logic inside the user object. It means there is a
        single place that we need to modify. Previously we had this logic in two different places -
        meaning we would have had to implement this change twice.</p>

      <p>Now on the server we need a new middleware function to check if the current user is an
        admin or not. In the middleware folder and a new file called admin.js with the following
        code:</p>

      module.exports = function(req, res, next) { }

      <p>We set module.exports to a middleware function that takes a request, a response and a
        reference to the next middleware function in the request processing pipeline. So here we're
        assuming this middleware function will be executed after the authorisation middleware
        function. Our authorisation middleware function sets req.user which means we can access that
        in our new function:</p>

      module.exports = function(req, res, next) { if(!req.user.isAdmin) return
      res.status(403).send('Access denied.'); }

      <p>If req.user.isAdmin is false we return response code 403 which means forbidden. This is one
        of the areas that a lot of developers get wrong. So we have:</p>

      401 Unauthorized - the user tries to access a protected resource without a valid JWT 403
      Forbidden - the user sends a valid JWT but they are not authorized to access the resource
      (e.g. non-admin)

      <p>So if the user isAdmin we pass control to the next middleware function:</p>
      next();
      <p>Which in this case is the route handler. Now we are going to apply this middleware function
        on one of our routes. In the delete api endpoint of genres we pass two middleware functions
        using an array</p>

      router.delete('/:id', [auth, admin], async (req, res) => { }

      <p>The first one is auth and the second is admin. These middleware functions will be executed
        in sequence. First auth - if the client sends a valid Json web token, then we'll get to the
        second middleware function. If the user is an admin then the third middleware function or
        route handler will be executed. Import the admin middleware function at the top of
        genre.js:</p>

      const admin = require(''../middleware/admin');

      <h3>141 - Testing the Authorization</h3>

      <p>So back in MongoDB Compass, go to the genres collection and copy a valid genre id. In
        Postman send a delete request to:</p>

      http://localhost:5000/api/genres/5c43a8a94e22960a2c26ef3f

      <p>So initially I don't have a token.</p>

      <p>We receive a response status 401 Unauthorized with the message:</p>

      Access denied. No token provided.

      <p>Next use Postman to login with a user that is not an admin and copy the resulting JWT. You
        can verify that the user is not an admin using the debugger at jwt.io - you should only see
        the _id and _iat properties . Let's verify that this user cant delete genres.</p>

      <p>You will receive a response status 403 Forbidden with the message:</p>

      Access denied

      <p>Now login at the auth endpoint with a user that IS NOT an admin:</p>

      http://localhost:3000/api/auth

      <p>In the response body you should receive a JWT:</p>

      eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE1NDc5OTM3NDd9.LHozVfSKCYNMdXoGnZ_qcDGqbjFjHp8RuSMolDd6Ahc

      <p>We can verify that this user is not an admin by going to JWT debugger (jwt.io) and pasting
        the JWT into the encoded section:</p>

      fig xx-xx

      <p>If you check the payload you should see only the id property (and iat) we don't have
        isAdmin. So, this user should not be able to delete a genre. We can verify that by using
        Postman to send another delete request to the genres endpoint:</p>

      http://localhost:5000/api/genres/5c43a8a94e22960a2c26ef3f

      <p>We add the x-auth-token to the headers (make sure you are in headers NOT Params. Send this
        request and you should get 403 - forbidden with a message in the body:</p>

      Access denied.

      <p>Now, in contrast, if we log in with a user that is an admin then we should be able to
        delete the genre.</p>

      <>So now login at the auth endpoint with a user that IS an admin:
    </
    >

    http://localhost:3000/api/auth

    <p>Copy the JWT (which is a little bit longer than previous JWT's) into JWT debugger. If you
      check the payload then isAdmin should be set to true.</p>

    { "_id": "5c445adddfbdc04b04613d8a", "isAdmin": true, "iat": 1547994978 }

    <p>Next, copy and paste this JWT in the DELETE Genre request in Postman, hit Send and you will
      receive a response status 200 OK and the deleted Genre object in the body of the response:</p>

    { "_id": "5c43a8a94e22960a2c26ef3f", "name": "Griller", "__v": 0 }

    <p>One last thing before we finish the lecture. In this simple application we have a single
      isAdmin property to determine if the user is an admin or not. In your application you might
      have multiple roles:</p>

    admin moderator etc.

    <p>In that case you would need a property like roles:</p>

    isAdmin: Boolean, roles: []

    <p>This would be an array. This could contain strings or complex objects, that really depends on
      the scope of your application. In a more advanced application instead of managing roles you
      would manage operations, that is the operations that the user is allowed to perform:</p>

    isAdmin: Boolean, roles: [], operations []

    <p>operations would be an array of complex objects. For example, for a given user, we would say
      this user is allowed to delete genres, or create genres. So you would control access at a more
      granular level. Now, irrespective or which approach you choose, the big picture is still the
      same. You pass something that determines the level of access of the user in the JWT that is
      generated as part of authenticating the user. Then you would add middleware, where currently
      we are just checking the value of this boolean property:</p>

    if(!req.user.isAdmin) return res.status(403).send('Access denied.');

    <p>In a more complex application we can look at the roles array or the operations array. Based
      on that, you make a decision, you either decline access:</p>

    return res.status(403)

    <p>or grant it:</p>

    <h3>142 - Recap</h3>
    <h4>Authentication and Authorization</h4>
    <p>So, in this section, you learned that:</p>
    <p>Authentication is the process of determining if the user is who he/she claims to be. It
      involves validating their email/password.</p>
    <p>Authorization is the process of determining if the user has permission to perform a given
      operation. - To hash passwords, use bcrypt</p>
    <h4>Hashing passwords</h4>
    const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10); const hashed = await bcrypt.hash(‘1234’, salt); //
    Validating passwords const isValid = await bcrypt.compare(‘1234’, hashed);

    <p>A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a JSON object encoded as a long string. We use them to identify
      users. It’s similar to a passport or driver’s license. It includes a few public properties
      about a user in its payload. These properties cannot be tampered because doing so requires
      re-generating the digital signature.</p>

    <p>When the user logs in, we generate a JWT on the server and return it to the client. We store
      this token on the client and send it to the server every time we need to call an API endpoint
      that is only accessible to authenticated users.</p>

    <p>To generate JSON Web Tokens in an Express app use jsonwebtoken package.</p>

    <h4>Generating a JWT</h4>

    const jwt = require(‘jsonwebtoken’); const token = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id}, ‘privateKey’);

    <p>Never store private keys and other secrets in your codebase. Store them in environment
      variables. Use the config package to read application settings stored in environment
      variables.</p>

    <p>When appropriate, encapsulate logic in Mongoose models:</p>

    <h4>Adding a method to a Mongoose model</h4>

    userSchema.methods.generateAuthToken = function() { } const token = user.generateAuthToken();

    <p>Implement authorization using a middleware function. Return a 401 error (unauthorized) if the
      client doesn’t send a valid token. Return 403 (forbidden) if the user provided a valid token
      but is not allowed to perform the given operation.</p>

    <p>You don’t need to implement logging out on the server. Implement it on the client by simply
      removing the JWT from the client.</p>

    <p>Do not store a JWT in plain text in a database. This is similar to storing users’ passports
      or drivers license in a room. Anyone who has access to that room can steal these passports.
      Store JWTs on the client. If you have a strong reason for storing them on the server, make
      sure to encrypt them before storing them in a database.</p>
