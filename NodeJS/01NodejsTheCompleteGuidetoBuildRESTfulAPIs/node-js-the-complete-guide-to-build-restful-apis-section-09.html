        <h3>112 - Modelling Relationships</h3>
        <p>So in all the examples we have looked at so far we have worked with single, self-contained documents. In the
          real world, the entities and concepts that we work with, they have some kind of association. For example, you
          can have a Course object or document and of course this course has an author. But the Author is more than just
          a name - it's more than just a simple string.</p>

        <p>You might have a collection of Authors where we store author documents. In each author document we could have
          properties like name, website, image etc. In this lecture we will discuss how to work with related objects.
          There are two approaches:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Using References (Normalization)</li>
          <li>Using Embedded Documents (De-normalization)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With the first approach, references, we have a separate collection for storing our Authors. So we can have an
          Author object like this:</p>
        let author = { name: 'Mosh' }
        <p>We can add various properties in the author object and then we would have a separate collection where we
          store course objects like this:</p>
        let course = { author: 'id' }
        <p>So here we have a course object. We set the author to the id of an author document in the authors collection.
          So here we are using a reference.</p>
        <p>For clarification, in relational databases, we have this concept of relationships which enforces data
          integrity. However in MongoDB or NoSQL databases in general, we don't really have a relationship. So even
          though I'm setting the ID of an author here there is actually no association or relationship between the
          author and course object in the database. This means it is possible to set the author's id property to
          something invalid and MonoDB doesn't care about that.</p>
        <p>Now we could take this example to the next level by saying that a course might have multiple authors. So
          instead of the author property we could have authors which we set to an array of references where we store
          multiple id's:</p>

        let course = { author: 'id', authors: [ 'id1', 'id2' ] }

        However, for simplicity, let's just work with a single author:

        let course = { author: 'id' }

        <p>The other approach is to use embedded documents or de-normalization. We can embed an author document inside
          of a course document. So here we can have a course object or document and in this document we have the author
          property which we set to an object:</p>

        let course = { author: { name: 'Mosh' } }

        <p>The object will contain all the properties relevant to an Author. So we are embedding a document inside of
          another document. This is called de-normalization. If you have never worked with NoSQL databases before and
          you come from a relational database background, you may think that the first approach is the way to go.
          However, that is not necessarily the case when working with NoSQL databases - each approach has it's strength
          and weaknesses. What approach you choose really depends on your application and it's querying
          requirements.</p>

        <p>So basically, you need to do a trade-off between query performance versus consistency. With the first
          approach (references or normalization) you have a single place to define an author. If tomorrow, I decide to
          change the name of this author from Mosh to Mosh Hamedani, there is a single place that I need to modify. All
          courses that are referencing that author will automatically see the update.</p>

        <p>This means the first approach provides consistency. However, every time we want to query a course we need to
          do an extra query to load the related author. Sometimes that extra query may not be a big deal but in certain
          situations you might want to make sure a query runs as fast as possible. If that's the case you need to look
          at the second approach - using embedded documents.</p>

        <p>With this approach we can load a course object and it's author using a single query because the author is
          embedded inside the course object or the course document. However, with this approach, if tomorrow I decide to
          change the name of this author from Mosh to Mosh Hamedani then the chances are there will be multiple course
          documents that need to be updated. If our update operation doesn't complete successfully, it is possible that
          we wil have some course documents that are not updated. This will result in inconsistent data.</p>

        <p>So, in every part of your application, you will need to think about the queries that you will run ahead of
          time. You will design your database based on those queries.</p>

        <p>There is a third approach, known as the hybrid approach. Imagine, for example, that each author has 50
          properties. We don't want duplicate all those properties inside every course in database. So we can have a
          separate collection of authors, but instead of using a reference here, we can embed an author document inside
          of a course document but not the complete representation for that author. So, with the hybrid approach, our
          database will look like this:</p>

        // Hybrid let author = { name: 'Mosh' // 50 other properties }

        <p>Now we have a separate collection of courses. In this collection we'll have course documents like this:</p>

        let course = { author: { id: 'ref', // Reference to an author document name: 'Mosh' // Only embed a subset of
        properties - not the complete representation of an author document } }

        <p>The id property is a reference to an author document. The name property is the name of the author as a string
          and is embedded into the course document. With this approach we can quickly read a course object, along with
          it's author, so we can optimize our query performance but we don't have to store all the properties of an
          author inside a course document.</p>

        <p>This approach is particularly useful if you want to have a snapshot of your data at a point in time. For
          example, imagine you were designing an e-commerce site. There we will have collections like orders, products,
          shopping carts and so on. In each order, we need to store the snapshot of a product, because we want to know
          the price of that product at a given point in time. That's where the hybrid approach is useful.</p>

        <p>So, again, which approach you use really depends on the application you are building - there is no right or
          wrong. Each approach has it's strength and weaknesses.</p>

        <h3>113 - Referencing Documents</h3>

        <p>In this lecture, we will discuss how to reference a document in another document. The demo code contains two
          modules. The first is author with three properties:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>name</li>
          <li>bio</li>
          <li>website</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The other is course with one property: name</p>
        <p>In this lecture we will add another property - author where we will reference an author document. We also
          have a few helper functions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>createAuthor</li>
          <li>createCourse</li>
          <li>listCourses</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All these functions are similar to what you have seen earlier in this section - so there is nothing new
          here.</p>
        <p>Now before getting started go to MongoDB compass and delete the playground database so we can start on a
          clean canvas.</p>
        <p>At the bottom of index.js you can see we have a call to the creatAuthor function.</p>
        createAuthor('Mosh', 'My bio', 'My Website');
        <p>Run the application:</p>
        Connected to MongoDB... { _id: 5c33787f925b1d69c861529e, name: 'Node Course', author: 5ad1e8e7d8773c8828a03c3b,
        __v: 0 }
        <p>So we created one Author - you can see the id above. Now let's copy this and then back in the code comment
          out the call to createAuthor and enable createCourse pasting in the id from above:</p>

        createCourse('Node Course', '5c33787f925b1d69c861529e');

        <p>If you look at the implementation of this function we create a course object with two properties:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>name</li>
          <li>author</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Save the file, and back in the terminal run the application again:</p>
        Connected to MongoDB... { _id: 5c338a931514bb0cc4f07ae0, name: 'Node Course' __v: 0 }
        <p>This has created a course object - you can see the id and name above but we don't have an author. The reason
          for this is because when we defined this course model we only added the name property:</p>

        const Course = mongoose.model('Course', new mongoose.Schema({ name: String } }));

        <p>So when saving a course object, only the properties that you have defined in your model will be persisted in
          the database. So here, in our model, we need to add another property author:</p>

        const Course = mongoose.model('Course', new mongoose.Schema({ name: String, author: { type:
        mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Author' } }));

        <p>We set this to a schema type object. The type of this property should be ObjectId. So we use
          mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId. We also set a property called ref and specify the target collection - Author.
          In the author property we will store an ObjectId that references an author document. However, once again, we
          don't really have a proper relationship here. We can store a course with an invalid author, and Mongo doesn't
          complain about that.</p>
        <p>So now have modified the model run the application again:</p>
        Connected to MongoDB... { _id: 5c338a931514bb0cc4f07ae0, name: 'Node Course', author: 5c33787f925b1d69c861529e,
        __v: 0 }
        <p>we now have the author property. Now, back in MongoDB compass, let's look at this playground database and our
          courses collection:</p>
        //TODO fig xx-xx
        <p>You can see we have two documents. The first one doesn't have an author, but the second one does.</p>
        <h3>114 - Population</h3>
        <p>In this lecture, we will get all the courses along with their Authors. Let's enable the call to
          listCourses():</p>
        listCourses();
        <p>In this function:</p>
        async function listCourses() { const courses = await Course .find() .select('name author -_id');
        console.log(courses); }
        <p>We are calling the find method to get all the courses and we're selecting only their name property. Save the
          changes and run the application.</p>
        [ { _id: 5c33787f925b1d69c861529e, name: 'Node Course' }, { _id: 5c338c91ab5cad1bf8984ace, name: 'Node Course' }
        ]
        <p>We only get _id and name in the results. If we add author:</p>
        async function listCourses() { const courses = await Course .find() .select('name author');
        console.log(courses); }
        <p>The results:</p>
        [ { _id: 5c33787f925b1d69c861529e, name: 'Node Course' }, { _id: 5c338a931514bb0cc4f07ae0, name: 'Node Course',
        author: 5c33787f925b1d69c861529e } ]
        <p>Our second document now has an author. We are only getting the reference or the object id here. In a real
          world application, you want to load this author document so we can display it's name. That's where we can call
          the populate method:</p>
        async function listCourses() { const courses = await Course .find() .populate('author') .select('name author');
        console.log(courses); }
        <p>As the first argument we specify the path to a given property - in this case author. And because earlier,
          when defining the course model, we set author to be an ObjectId and we referenced the Author collection:</p>
        const Course = mongoose.model('Course', new mongoose.Schema({ name: String, author: { type:
        mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Author' } }));
        <p>When we load a course object and populate the author property, Mongoose knows that it should query the
          authors collection in MongoDB. Run the application:</p>

        Connected to MongoDB... [ { _id: 5c33787f925b1d69c861529e, name: 'Node Course' }, { _id:
        5c338a931514bb0cc4f07ae0, name: 'Node Course', author: { _id: 5c35c8042a373608dcac60ad, name: 'Mosh', bio: 'My
        bio', website: 'My Website', __v: 0 } } ]

        <p>Our first document doesn't have an author so we don't get anything. Our second course does have an author and
          we can see a complete representation of an author document. In a real world application, an author can have
          multiple properties. Perhaps when showing a list of courses, we don't want to get all the additional
          properties of the author - maybe you just want to get the name property.</p>
        <p>We can achieve this by supplying a second argument to the populate method which specifies the properties you
          want to include or exclude:</p>
        .populate('author', 'name -_id')
        <p>If you run the application again:</p>
        [ { _id: 5c33787f925b1d69c861529e, name: 'Node Course' }, { _id: 5c338a931514bb0cc4f07ae0, name: 'Node Course',
        author: { name: 'Mosh' } }, { _id: 5c338c91ab5cad1bf8984ace, name: 'Node Course', author: null } ]
        <p>Now the author property only contains the name property. It's also possible to use the populate method to
          populate multiple properties. For example, let's imagine that each course has a category and the category
          references the category document. So here we can call populate again, add category, and optionally pick only
          the name property of each category document:</p>

        async function listCourses() { const courses = await Course .find() .populate('author', 'name -_id')
        .populate('category', 'name') .select('name author'); console.log(courses); }

        <p>One last thing to finish the lecture. Earlier we discussed how Mongo doesn't have relationships or data
          integrity in our database. So here in our courses collection it is possible to set our author to an invalid
          document. You can use Compass to simulate this by manually editing the ObjectId of the author property:</p>
        //TODO fig xx-xx
        <p>MongoDB allows you to make this modification without complaining. If you run the application:</p>
        Connected to MongoDB... [ { _id: 5c33787f925b1d69c861529e, name: 'Node Course' }, { _id:
        5c338a931514bb0cc4f07ae0, name: 'Node Course', author: null }, { _id: 5c338c91ab5cad1bf8984ace, name: 'Node
        Course', author: null } ]
        <p>You can see the author is now null because there is no author with the given id in our database.</p>
        <h3>115 - Embedding Documents</h3>
        <p>So in the last lecture you learned how to use references to relate documents. In this lecture we are going to
          look at another technique which is embedding documents.</p>
        <p>Here we have the authorSchema exactly as it was in the previous lecture:</p>
        const authorSchema = new mongoose.Schema({ name: String, bio: String, website: String });
        <p>With three properties - name, bio and website. We have an Author model:</p>
        const Author = mongoose.model('Author', authorSchema);
        <p>Below that we have the Course model:</p>
        const Course = mongoose.model('Course', new mongoose.Schema({ name: String }));
        <p>Here we don't have the Author property. That's what we are going to add in this lecture. In the last lecture
          we set the type of our author property to an ObjectId and referenced the Author collection:</p>
        const Course = mongoose.model('Course', new mongoose.Schema({ name: String, author: { type:
        mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Author' } }));
        <p>In this lecture we are going to embed an author document directly inside of the course document:</p>
        const Course = mongoose.model('Course', new mongoose.Schema({ name: String, author: { type: authorSchema } }));
        <p>We set the type of the author property to authorSchema which is defined here:</p>
        const authorSchema = new mongoose.Schema({ name: String, bio: String, website: String });
        <p>That is the only change we need to make. Now let's take a look at the createCourse function:</p>
        async function createCourse(name, author) { const course = new Course({ name, author });
        <p>We take a course name and an author, initialize the course and save it, as we did previously.</p>
        <p>At the end of the file we have a call to the createCourse function:</p>
        createCourse('Node Course', new Author({ name: 'Mosh' }));
        <p>Before going any further open MongoDB Compass and delete the playground database. We want to start on a clean
          canvas to make sure we are on the same page.</p>
        <p>Run the application:</p>
        Connected to MongoDB... { _id: 5c35d9d06cfab944e4ae7c51, name: 'Node Course', author: { _id:
        5c35d9d06cfab944e4ae7c50, name: 'Mosh' }, __v: 0 }
        <p>You can see the new course document. We can see author is an object with two properties - id and name. So
          this is an embedded or sub-document. These sub-documents are like normal documents so most features that are
          available in normal documents are also available in sub documents. For example, we can implement validation
          here, we can enforce that author.name should be required.</p>
        <p>However, these sub-documents, cannot be created on their own. They can only be saved in the context of their
          parent. So let's say I want to change the name of this author. Copy the course id. Create a new function:</p>
        async function updateAuthor(courseId) { const course = await Course.findById(courseId); course.author.name =
        'Mosh Hamedani'; course.save(); }
        <p>First we find a course with the given id. Now, we can modify the author:</p>
        course.author.name = 'Mosh Hamedani';
        <p>Now we can call course.save(). Bear in mind we don't have course.author.save() - that does not exist.</p>
        <p>Let's add a call to this function:</p>
        updateAuthor('5ac4da76334f0d2cf09211e5');
        <p>Run the application again. To check the document has been updated look at Compass. Refresh the view then
          browse the playground database, courses collection, course document, author property. You should see the
          author name has been updated:</p>
        //TODO fig xx-xx
        <p>We can also update a sub-document directly. So, instead of querying it first, we can update it directly in
          the database:</p>
        async function updateAuthor(courseId) { const course = await Course.update({ _id: courseId}, { $set: {
        'author.name': 'John Smith' } }); }
        <p>We replace findById with update passing a query object as the first argument. The second argument is our
          update object. We use the set operator, which we have seen before, which we set to an object. Here we pass one
          or more key/value pairs. To access the a nested property we use the dot notation. Let's say we want to update
          the name of the author of a course:</p>
        'author.name': 'John Smith'
        <p>With this we don't need to modify this object in memory and save it explicitly. We update it directly in the
          database. So back in the terminal run the application again. Go into Compass and refresh. You should see the
          author name has been updated.</p>
        <p>If you want to remove the sub-document you use the unset operator:</p>
        async function updateAuthor(courseId) { const course = await Course.update({ _id: courseId}, { $unset: {
        'author': '' } }); }
        <p>We can specify author.name to remove the nested property or we can specify author to remove the sub-document
          as a whole (as in the code above)</p>
        <p>As discussed previously, these sub-documents are similar to normal documents, so here we can enforce
          validation. We can enforce that every course should have an author, so here's the definition of our course
          schema:</p>
        const Course = mongoose.model('Course', new mongoose.Schema({ name: String, author: authorSchema }));
        <p>If you want to make this author property required we need to pass a Schema type object setting the type to
          authorSchema and the required property to true:</p>
        const Course = mongoose.model('Course', new mongoose.Schema({ name: String, author: { type: authorSchema,
        required: true } }));
        <p>This syntax is identical to the validation we looked at in the section on Mongoose data validation. If you
          want to make a specific property in the author document required you apply that validation on the author
          sub-document itself:</p>
        const authorSchema = new mongoose.Schema({ name: { type: String, required: true }, bio: String, website: String
        });
        <p>We specify a schema type object and set the required property to true.</p>
        <h3>116 - Using an Array of Sub-documents</h3>
        <p>So in the last lecture we add an author as a sub-document in the course document. In this lecture, I'm going
          to show you how to change this to an array of sub-documents.</p>
        <p>First rename the property to authors, then change it's value to an array of authorSchema:</p>
        const Course = mongoose.model('Course', new mongoose.Schema({ name: String, authors: [authorSchema] }));
        <p>We need to modify the createCourse function so that when creating an array we pass an array of authors:</p>
        async function createCourse(name, authors) { const course = new Course({ name, authors });
        <p>Finally, in the call to createCourse, instead of passing one author object we pass an array:</p>
        createCourse('Node Course', [ new Author({ name: 'Mosh' }), new Author({ name: 'John'}) ]);
        <p>Now back in Compass delete the courses collection. Run the application:</p>
        Connected to MongoDB... { authors: [ { _id: 5c361a1ad2643c0ab0b8237f, name: 'Mosh' }, { _id:
        5c361a1ad2643c0ab0b82380, name: 'John' } ], _id: 5c361a1ad2643c0ab0b82381, name: 'Node Course', __v: 0 }
        <p>In Compass refresh and look at the new document that has been created in the courses collection:</p>
        //TODO fig xx-xx
        <p>You can see the courses collection and the course document with an array of authors. Every Author is an
          object and when you expand you see two properties _id and name.</p>
        <p>We can add authors to this array at a later date if required. Back in the code, let's create a new function
          called addAuthor:</p>
        async function addAuthor(courseId, author) { const course = await Course.findById(courseId);
        course.authors.push(author); course.save(); }
        <p>First we find a course, then we push the author into the authors array. At this point our changes are not
          saved to the database so we call course.save.</p>
        <p>Add a call to the addAuthor function:</p>
        addAuthor('5c361a1ad2643c0ab0b82381', new Author({ name: 'Amy'}));
        <p>Run the application and check in Compass to ensure the new Author has been successfully added to the
          array.</p>
        <p>Removing an Author is very similar:</p>
        async function removeAuthor(courseId, authorId) { const course = await Course.findById(courseId); const author =
        course.authors.id(authorId); author.remove(); course.save(); }
        <p>We supply two parameters - courseId and authorId. We use the findById method to find the course. Next we use
          dot notation to goto course.authors and here we have an id method. The id method can be used to lookup a child
          object by it's id. So we pass the authorId and store the returned author object in a const called author. Now
          we can call the remove method on the author object. Finally we call course.save();</p>
        <p>Add a call to the removeAuthor function:</p>
        removeAuthor('5c361a1ad2643c0ab0b82381', '5c361cafe15b1105e4afb80a');
        <p>Run the application and take a look at the data in Compass:</p>
        //TODO fig xx-xx
        <p>The specified author should have been removed.</p>
        <p>This is how we work with sub-documents.</p>
        <h3>117 - Project - Build the Movies API</h3>
        <p>Alright now, I want to get back to our vidly project, and build an API to manage the list of movies. Now,
          don't think that this is exactly like managing the list of genres, this exercise is more challenging.</p>
        <p>So this is the shape of the movies that we want to store in MongoDB:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>title: String</li>
          <li>genre An embedded genre object</li>
          <li>numberInStock Number</li>
          <li>dailyRentalRate Number</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that the vidly database already contains a genres collection but we are embedding genre documents inside
          a movie document to optimize the performance of our queries. Also, take into account, that it's very unlikely
          that we will rename the name of a genre in the future - sci-fi is sci-fi, thriller is thriller so in this
          particular case, I'm not worried about our data becoming inconsistent in the future.</p>
        <p>You might be curious why we still need a separate genres collection. Somewhere in our application on the
          client side you may want to have a drop-down list that allows the user to select the genre for a movie. For
          this reason, we will keep the genres collection - querying this collection is much easier than querying all
          the movies and then getting the unique list of genres.</p>
        <p>To save time we wont type the solution out by hand. You can download it as a zip file attached to this
          lecture. Here we will just highlight the key points that are important to understand.</p>
        <p>Let's start with our movie model and the Movie schema:</p>
        const Movie = mongoose.model('Movies', new mongoose.Schema({ title: { type: String, required: true, trim: true,
        minlength: 5, maxlength: 255 }, genre: { type: genreSchema, required: true }, numberInStock: { type: Number,
        required: true, min: 0, max: 255 }, dailyRentalRate: { type: Number, required: true, min: 0, max: 255 } }));
        <p>We have a title property which is a string that is required. trimming is also enabled to get rid of any
          paddings around the title of the movie. I set the minimum length to five characters and the maximum length to
          255 characters. This is because I don't want a malicious client to send a very long string t hat could
          potentially cause problems in our application.</p>
        <p>Next we have genre. I have set the type of this genre to genreSchema. In the code above the model definition
          you can see we have created a genreSchema constant and loaded it from our genre module:</p>
        const { genreSchema } = require('./genre');
        <p>The genreSchema is defined in a file called genre.js. Previously we didn't define the genreSchema separately.
          Instead it was defined directly in the call to mongoose.model. However, because we need to reference the
          genreSchema in our movie module it has been extracted into a separate constant that can be reused in multiple
          places.</p>
        <p>Also at the end of the genre module we add the genreSchema to our module.exports:</p>
        exports.genreSchema = genreSchema;
        <p>So back in the Movie module, next we have the numberInStock property which is a required number. The min is
          set to 0 because we don't want to end up with a negative number here. This kind of validation ensures our
          application behaves properly. We also set a maximum of 255 character. Again this is to prevent a malicious
          client to sending a very large number that could potentially cause problems in our application.</p>
        <p>The same is true for the last property dailyRentalRate.</p>
        <p>Below the definition of our Schema and model we have our validateMovie function. This is where we define our
          Joi schema:</p>
        function validateMovie(movie) { const schema = { title: Joi.string().min(5).max(50).required(), genreId:
        Joi.string().required(), numberInStock: Joi.number().min(0).required(), dailyRentalRate:
        Joi.number().min(0).required() };
        <p>This is different to our Mongoose schema. Note that our Joi schema has a property called genreId not genre
          because we want the client to send only the Id of a genre. Therefore the genreId is set to a string that is
          required.</p>
        <p>In contrast in our Mongoose schema we have genre which is a complex object. So you can see that in a real
          world application your Mongoose Schema can start to grow independent of your Joi Schema.</p>
        <p>The Joi schema validates what the client sends us - the input to our API. The Mongoose Schema is a
          representation of our model in the application. That's our persistence model, that's what we're store as a
          document in MongoDB.</p>
        <p>So that covers our movie module. Now let's take a look at our movies routes. We will overview just one route
          here - the one that calls the post method to create a new movie:</p>
        router.post('/', async (req, res) => { const { error } = validate(req.body); if (error) return
        res.status(400).send(error.details[0].message); const genre = await Genre.findById(req.body.genreId); if
        (!genre) return res.status(400).send('Invalid genre.'); let movie = new Movie({ title: req.body.title, genre: {
        _id: genre._id, name: genre.name }, numberInStock: req.body.numberInStock, dailyRentalRate:
        req.body.dailyRentalRate }); movie = await movie.save(); res.send(movie); });
        <p>At the top we validate the object that we send in the request, if it's invalid we return a 400 error which is
          bad request (as we did before). After that we have something new. We use findById to find a genre. If it
          doesn't exist we return the 400 error with the message 'Invalid genre.'. This makes sure that the genreId that
          the client sends represents a valid genre.</p>
        <p>Below that we create the movie object. We set the title based on what we get in the request but for genre we
          set the value to a complex object with two properties - _id and name. We read both of these from the genre.
          You might ask why I didn't send this genre to the genre objected that we loaded in the code nearer the top of
          the post method:</p>
        const genre = await Genre.findById(req.body.genreId);
        <p>The reason we don't do that is that, is because this genre object, also has a version property that is set by
          Mongo which we dont want in movie.genre. Also, in a more complex application, the object that we load when we
          call Genre.findById may have 50 properties. We don't want to store all those properties when embedding the
          genre document in the movie document. That's why we selectively set the properties.</p>
        <p>The rest of the code in the vidly application, as it currently stands, is pretty self explanatory.</p>
        <h3>118 - Project - Build the Rentals API</h3>
        <p>So far we have built APIs to manage customer, genres and movies. Now let's take this application to the next
          level.</p>
        <p>I want you to implement an API to manage the rentals:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a new rental POST /api/rentals</li>
          <li>Get the list of rentals GET /api/rentals</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>In the models folder we have a new module rental. Let's take a look at the schema:</p>
        <span>const Rental = mongoose.model('Rental', new mongoose.Schema({ customer: { type: new mongoose.Schema({ name: {
          type: String, required: true, minlength: 5, maxlength: 50 }, isGold: { type: Boolean, default: false }, phone:
          { type: String, required: true, minlength: 5, maxlength: 50 } }), required: true }, movie: { type: new
          mongoose.Schema({ title: { type: String, required: true, trim: true, minlength: 5, maxlength: 255 },
          dailyRentalRate: { type: Number, required: true, min: 0, max: 255 } }), required: true }, dateOut: { type:
          Date, required: true, default: Date.now }, dateReturned: { type: Date }, rentalFee: { type: Number, min: 0 }
          }));</span>
        <p>
          We have a customer property with the type set to a custom schema that is defined here:</p>
        customer: { type: new mongoose.Schema({
        <p>In other words I am not reusing the customer Schema we defined
        in the customer module. The reason for this is that because our customer can have 50 properties. We don't want
        to have all those properties inside the Rental object. We only need the primary properties that we need when
        displaying the list of rentals. So we have:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>name</li>
          <li>isGold</li>
        </ul>
        <p>perhaps we want to give a discount to our gold customers - phone - when we look at a list or rentals or a
          single rental it might be handy to have contact information for this customer</p>
        <p>You might ask, what if in the future we need to display more information about this customer on the rental
          page. Here we will have the id of the customer as well so for anything additional we can always send a GET
          request to our customer API to get a complete representation of our customer.</p>
        <p>By the same token we have a movie property set to a custom schema:</p>
        movie: { type: new mongoose.Schema({
        <p>We have not re-used the movie Schema that we defined in movie.js. This
        is for the same reason as before - our movie may have 50 properties and we don't want to add them all here. So
        for a rental object or rental document, we only need the title of the movie and dailyRentalRate because in the
        future we are going to use this to calculate the rental fee. If we include this in an embedded document we don't
        need and additional query for the movies collection to calculate the rental fee.</p>
        <p>Note that both the customer and the movie are marked as required:</p>
        required: true <p>We have another property that is called dateOut:</p>
        dateOut: { type: Date, required: true, default: Date.now }, <p>It's a date, it's required and the default value
        for this property is the current date/time.</p>
        <p>We also need another property called dateReturned:</p>
        dateReturned: { type: Date },
        <p>This is also a date but it's not required because initially we don't have a
        value for this property and then in the future when this customer returns a movie we will set this value.</p>
        <p>The last property is rentalFee:</p>
        rentalFee: { type: Number, min: 0 } <p>which is a number that cannot be less than zero.</p>
        <p>So this is the shape of our rental documents in MongoDB.</p>
        <p>Next we have the validateRental function:</p>
        function validateRental(rental) { const schema = { customerId: Joi.string().required(), movieId:
        Joi.string().required() }; <p>Note that the schema we have here is very different to the schema we defined in
        our rental documents in MongoDB. Here we have only two properties - customerId and MovieId. These are the
        properties that the client sends to the server because we don't want the client to set the dateOut property.
        This should be set on the server based on the current date/time. By the same toke we don't want the client to
        set dateReturned or rentalFee. These should be set on the server. So, when creating a new rental, the client
        should send only two values - customerId and movieId.</p>
        <p>Now let's take a look at the API implementation in routes\rentals.js.</p>
        <p>We have an endpoint to get the list of rentals:</p>
        router.get('/', async (req, res) => { const rentals = await Rental.find().sort('-dateOut'); res.send(rentals);
        }); <p>Very simple - just like before except that here we are sorting by dateOut in a descending order. That's
        why we have the minus sign.</p>
        <p>Now let's take a look at our other route for creating a new rental. First we validate the request:</p>
        const { error } = validate(req.body); if (error) return res.status(400).send(error.details[0].message); <p>If
        it's not valid we send a 400 error. After that we want to make sure that the customer id that the customer is
        sending us is a valid customer. That's why here we find the customer by id:</p>
        const customer = await Customer.findById(req.body.customerId); if (!customer) return
        res.status(400).send('Invalid customer.'); <p>If we don't find the customer we respond with a 400 error and say
        this is an invalid customer.</p>
        <p>By the same token, we need to validate the movie id that the client sends us. We find the movie and if it
          doesn't exist we return a 400 error:</p>
        const movie = await Movie.findById(req.body.movieId); if (!movie) return res.status(400).send('Invalid movie.');
        <p>We also want to make sure that the movie we are renting out is in stock. So, if numberInStock is 0 we return
          a 400 error:</p>
        if (movie.numberInStock === 0) return res.status(400).send('Movie not in stock.'); <p>After this point
        everything is valid so we create a new rental object:</p>
        let rental = new Rental({ customer: { _id: customer._id, name: customer.name, phone: customer.phone }, movie: {
        _id: movie._id, title: movie.title, dailyRentalRate: movie.dailyRentalRate } }); rental = await rental.save();
        <p>We set the customer object to a complex object with the _id, name and phone properties. We store the _id here
          because perhaps in the future we want more information about the customer that is not available in the rental
          document so we can query the customer later.</p>
        <p>Similarly we have the movie property which is a complex object with three properties - _id, title and
          dailyRentalRate. Note that here, we have not set the dateOut property. This is because earlier we defined the
          property to have a default value of the current date/time. So when we save this rental Mongoose will
          automatically set that property.</p>
        <p>After that we update the numberInStock property of the movie then save:</p>
        movie.numberInStock--; movie.save(); <p>Here, we have a problem. There are two separate operations. It is
        possible that after we save the rental something goes wrong, maybe our server crashes, or connection to MongoDB
        drops meaning that perhaps the second operation - movie.save() will not complete.</p>
        <p>That's where we need a transaction. With a transaction we can ensure that both these operations will update
          the state of our data in the database or none of them will be applied. So they are atomic - they both complete
          or the both roll back. Now in a lot of relational databases we have the concept of transactions. In MongoDB,
          we don't really have transactions.</p>
        <p>There is a technique that is called two phase commit which is beyond the scope of this course. In the next
          lecture, however, we will look at an npm package that simulates a transaction in Mongoose.</p>
        <h3>119 - Transactions</h3>
        <p>In some relational database like SQL server or MySQL we have the concept of transaction which basically means
          a group of operations that should be performed as a unit. So either all these operations will complete and
          change the state of the database or, if something fails at some point, all these operations that have been
          applied will be rolled back and our database will go back to it's initial state.</p>
        <p>Now, in MongoDB we don't have transactions as we have in these relational databases. We have a technique
          called two phase commit, which you can learn more about at:</p>
        https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/perform-two-phase-commits/ <p>This document clearly explains how to
        perform two phase commits using a real world example. Now, in this lecture, I'm going to introduce you to a
        library that uses the concept of transaction, but internally it implements this transaction using the two phase
        commit. So, back in the terminal, let's install fawn:</p>
        npm i fawn <p>The version I had installed was 2.1.5. In routes\rentals.js first we need to load fawn:</p>
        const Fawn = require('fawn'); <p>This a class with an initialize method that we need to call:</p>
        Fawn.init(mongoose); <p>Back in the post method where we create a rental object:</p>
        let rental = new Rental({ <p>We are no longer going to create the rental and update the movie explicitly.
        Instead we are going to create a task object which is like a transaction. So delete these three lines:</p>
        rental = await rental.save();
        movie.numberInStock--; movie.save(); <p>New up a Fawn task:</p>
        new Fawn.Task() <p>Here we can add one more operations. All these operations together will be treated as a unit.
        So we want to save the new rental to the rentals collection:</p>
        .save('rentals', rental) <p>Note that here you are working directly with the collection. That's why we need to
        pass the actual name of the collection, which is plural, not singular, and also note that this name is case
        sensitive (if you look in Compass you will see the name of the collections are all lowercase). This is our first
        operation - saving the rental.</p>
        <p>As part of this unit we also want to update the movies collection. Here, as the second arugment, we pass a
          query object to determine the movie, or movies that should be updated. The third argument is our update
          object. Here we use the increment operator setting the value to an object. The target property you want to
          update is numberInStock. We want to decrement this property by -1:</p>
        .update('movies', { _id: movie._id }, { $inc: { numberInStock: -1 } }) <p>So we have defined two operations:</p>
        .save('rentals', rental) .update('movies', { _id: movie._id }, { $inc: { numberInStock: -1 } }) <p>Maybe in your
        application, as part of performing this transaction, you want to remove a document somewhere else. So we could
        add another operation .remove You can read more about Fawn on their GitHub page documentation.</p>
        <p>So, after we chain all these operations, finally you need to call run():</p>
        new Fawn.Task() .save('rentals', rental) .update('movies', { _id: movie._id }, { $inc: { numberInStock: -1 } })
        .run(); <p>If you don't call run then none of the operations will be performed. Now, it's possible that
        something fails during this transaction so we need to wrap this in a try\catch block:</p>
        try { new Fawn.Task() .save('rentals', rental) .update('movies', { _id: movie._id }, { $inc: { numberInStock: -1
        } }) .run();
        res.send(rental); } catch(ex) { res.status(500).send('Something failed.'); } <p>If something fails we catch the
        exception and return a 500 error to the client which means internal server error. In a real world application at
        this point you want to log this exception so later you can come back and see what went wrong. We are going to
        have a separate section in the course about error handling and logging so for now don't worry about it.</p>
        <p>In MongoDB Compass delete the rentals collection. Run the application:</p>
        nodemon <p>Back in Compass look at the movies collection:</p>
        //TODO fig xx-xx <p>Here we have a movie with numberInStock of 8. We will create a new rental and then check the
        numberInStock has decremented by 1 to 7.</p>
        <p>In Postman send a post request to our rentals endpoint:</p>
        http://localhost:3000/api/rentals <p>In the body of the request I have a valid customerId and movieId:</p>
        { "customerId": "5c37c6fc99ee168d28f4f617", "movieId": "5c37c5bb99ee168d28f4f616" } <p>Let's send this and our
        response should be;</p>
        { "dateOut": "2019-01-10T22:29:06.114Z", "_id": "5c37c73299ee168d28f4f619", "customer": { "isGold": false,
        "_id": "5c37c6fc99ee168d28f4f617", "name": "Fred Smith", "phone": "07856 771163" }, "movie": { "_id":
        "5c37c5bb99ee168d28f4f616", "title": "Terminator", "dailyRentalRate": 2 } } <p>We can see dateOut, id, customer
        and movie.</p>
        <p>Now, back in the Compass, in the movies collection refresh the list and you should see the number in stock
          drops to 7. So this verifies that our transaction completed successfully.</p>
        <p>A question for you - In our post method we create our rental object</p>
        let rental = new Rental({ customer: { _id: customer._id, name: customer.name, phone: customer.phone }, movie: {
        _id: movie._id, title: movie.title, dailyRentalRate: movie.dailyRentalRate } }); <p>We only set customer and
        movie. Then in our try block we create the Fawn task, run it then send the rental object to the client. In this
        code we didn't set the id or dateOut property but in the body of the response we can see both the properties are
        set. So how did this happen?</p>
        <p>You might expect that MongoDB set the dateOut and id properties but in MongoDB we don't have these default
          values. We define them in our mongoose Schema. So when we create a new rental object Mongoose knows the Schema
          for this object, it looks at various properties and sets the default values. The same is true for the _id
          properties, MongoDB doesn't set this. The _id property is set before we save the document to the database. I
          didn't tell you this earlier because I didn't want confuse your with too many details.</p>
        <p>We will cover more about id in the next lecture. Let's look at one more thing before we finish this lecture.
          Back in Compass click the refresh collections button and you will see a new collection:</p>
        ojlinttaskcollections <p>So where did that come from? The Fawn library that we installed uses that collection to
        perform two phase commits. When we run the Fawn task it adds a new document to that collection that represents
        our transaction. Then it will execute each of the operations in the task independently then finally , when all
        the operations are complete, it will delete the document from the collection.</p>
        <h3>120 - ObjectId</h3>
        <p>In this lecture we are going to look at object id's in MongoDB. You may have noticed that when you store a
          document in MongoDB it sets the value of the _id property to a long string like this:</p>
        // _id: 5ac4aa5307ac0119b0e74255 <p>Here we have 24 characters where every two characters represent a byte. So
        essentially we have 12 bytes to uniquely identify a document in MongoDB. The twelve bytes are used in the
        following way:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>4 bytes: timestamp The time this document was created.</li>
          <li>3 bytes: machine identifier Two different machines will have two different identifiers.</li>
          <li>3 bytes: process identifier If you generate two object id's on the same machine but in different
            processes these two bytes will be different.
          </li>
          <li>3 bytes: counter If your on the same
            machine, in the same process at the same second but generate two different documents the counter bytes will be
            different</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Also, because a timestamp is included in the _id property, there is no need to create a separate property or
          document like createdAt. By the same token, if you want to sort your documents based on the creation time you
          can simply sort them by the id property.</p>
        <p>So with these twelve bytes we can uniquely identify the document in MongoDB. Having said that there is a
          very, very small chance that we will generate two object id's that are the same. Let's see how that can
          happen.</p>
        <p>You know that, in each byte, we have 8 bits and each bit holds either 0 or 1. So how many numbers can we
          represent?</p>
        - 1 byte = 8 bits - 2 ^ 8 = 256 <p>So with one byte we can store 256 different numbers. Now, as discussed, the
        last three bytes represent a counter. This is like the counter that you have probably seen in SQL Server, MySQL
        or other databases. So how many numbers can we store in 3 bytes: - 1 byte = 8 bits - 2 ^ 8 = 256 - 2 ^ 24 =
        16M</p>
        <p>So, if have the same second, on the same machine, in the same process and we generate more than 16M documents
          the counter bytes will overflow and that's where we will end up with two documents with the same object id.
          However, this is a very unlikely scenario for many applications out there. All we need to remember is the
          object id is almost unique but not 100 percent.</p>
        <p>Now you might be curious as to why we don't have a mechanism in MongoDB that guarantees uniqueness. For
          example, in database management systems like SQL server or My SQL, in each table we have an auto incrementing
          number that guarantees uniqueness. So next time we store a course record in our database the id of that course
          will be the id of the course plus 1. This approach guarantees the uniqueness of this identifier but it hurts
          scalability.</p>
        <p>In MongoDB the id we have here:</p>
        // _id: 5ac4aa5307ac0119b0e74255 <p>Is not generated by MongoDB itself. It is actually generated by MongoDB
        driver. So we have the MongoDB driver that talks to MongoDB. Because the id is generated by the driver, it
        means, we don't have to wait for MongoDB to generate a new unique identifier.</p>
        <p>That's why applications built on top of MongoDB are highly scalable. You can have several instances of
          MongoDB and we don't have to talk to a central place to get a unique identifier. The driver itself can
          generate an almost unique identifier using the twelve bytes we discussed above.</p>
        <p>So, when you build an application with Node and Express, you use Mongoose. As I told you before, Mongoose is
          an abstraction over MongoDB driver, so when you create a new object/document Mongoose talks to MongoDB driver
          to generate a new id, but it can also explicitly generate an id if you want to. Let's see how to do this.</p>
        const mongoose = require('mongoose');
        const id = new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(); console.log(id.getTimestamp()); <p>We call the getTimestamp() method
        that belongs to the object id. Run the application:</p>
        2019-01-11T15:46:38.000Z <p>We also have a static method on this ObjectId class for validating object ids:</p>
        const isValid = mongoose.Types.ObjectId.isValid('1234'); console.log(isValid); <p>Obviously this is not a valid
        object id so when we run the application we see:</p>
        false
        <h3>121 - Validating Object ID's</h3>
        <p>Back to our vidly application. In Postman we are going to send a POST request to our rentals endpoint:</p>
        http://localhost:3000/api/rentals
        <p>In the body of the request we have a valid customerId and movieId:</p>
        { "customerId": "5ac4aa5307ac0119b0e74255", "movieId": "5ac4ebc10227194c687cd3cb" } <p>Now let see what happens
        if we change the customerId object id in the body of the request to a value like 1234:</p>
        { "customerId": "1234", "movieId": "5ac4ebc10227194c687cd3cb" } <p>Run the application and send the request in
        Postman. Postman hangs and in the terminal you see the following error:</p>
        UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Unhandled promise rejection. This error originated either by throwing inside
        of an async function without a catch block, or by rejecting a promise which was not handled with .catch().
        (rejection id: 2) <p>This basically means we had a promise that was rejected but we didn't handle it properly.
        Now as I told you before we have a separate section about error handling and logging in the course so let's not
        worry about that part. Instead look at the error:</p>
        CastError: Cast to ObjectId failed for value "1234" at path "_id" for model "Customer" <p>So let's talk through
        the message to simplify it. We are talking about the Customer model and we are talking about the id property. In
        the error message you see the word path which represents a chain of properties. For example, a customer can have
        address, address can have street etc. So that's why we use path. Mongoose is complaining that it can't cast the
        value 1234 to ObjectId. Obviously, this is because, 1234 is not a valid ObjectId.</p>
        <p>The issue we have in our implementation is that we are not seeing a response from the POST request - We
          are getting a message in terminal</p>
        <p>In the situation where we send an invalid customerId we should receive a 400 error - bad request because the
          server cannot fulfill this request.</p>
        <p>Back in routes/rentals.js look at the handler for creating a new rental:</p>
        router.post('/', async (req, res) => { const { error } = validate(req.body);
        <p>At the top we validate the
        request. This ensures that we have a customerId and a movieId but it doesn't check if these values are valid
        object id's. The exception that we saw above is thrown by this line:</p>
        const customer = await Customer.findById(req.body.customerId); <p>When we call findById on the Customer class,
        if we pass an invalid object id we get the exception.</p>
        <p>One way to fix the problem is to add an if statement to check the type is valid:</p>
        if(!mongoose.Types.ObjectId.isValid(req.body.customerId)) return res.status(400).send('Invalid customer.'); <p>If
        the customerId is not a valid ObjectId we return an error 400. We would also have to check the movieId. However
        this is a bad implementation because earlier we defined this function to validate our request:</p>
        validate(req.body); <p>So the logic to check for valid object id's really belongs in the function above. So we
        would check to make sure that the customerId is a string, that has a value and is a valid ObjectId. If the input
        is in the right shape only then should we go to the database to find the Customer.</p>
        Go back to the validateRental function in models\rental.js:
        function validateRental(rental) { const schema = { customerId: Joi.string().required(), movieId:
        Joi.string().required() };
        return Joi.validate(rental, schema); } <p>Here we need to add validation because we need to:</p>
        - Talk to Mongoose - Call the isValid method of ObjectId.Type <p>Now, extending the validation is a little bit
        complex and you don't want to repeat that every time you need a validate function. There is actually an npm
        package for adding support to validating ObjectId's in Joi. So, back in the terminal:</p>
        npm i joi-objectid <p>The current version that get's installed is 2.0.0. Back in rental.js we need to load this
        module:</p>
        Joi.objectId = require('joi-objectid')(Joi);
        require('joi-objectid') returns a function. We call the function and return a reference to the Joi module
        defined above:
        const Joi = require('joi'); require('joi-objectid')(Joi); <p>The result of this is a function so we can set
        Joi.objectId to this function:</p>
        Joi.objectId = require('joi-objectid')(Joi); <p>objectId is a method on the Joi object. Back in the
        validateRental function we will change the definition of the customerId from Joi.string() to Joi.objectId()
        which is the method that we defined at the top of the module. We make the same change for the movieId:</p>
        function validateRental(rental) { const schema = { customerId: Joi.objectId().required(), movieId:
        Joi.objectId().required() };
        return Joi.validate(rental, schema); } <p>Now, back in the terminal, let's run the application again:</p>
        nodemon <p>In Postman send another POST request with an invalid customerId. You should see the following:</p>
        "customerId" with value "1234" fails to match the required pattern: /^[0-9a-fA-F]{24}$/ <p>You should also
        receive a 400 - Bad Request. The Terminal should now also not be showing the unhandled promise rejection.</p>
        <h3>122 - A Better Implementation</h3>
        <p>Back in rental.js it is likely that we will use the Joi.objectId() method in other places in our application,
          like in the movie module or the customer module.</p>
        <p>We don't want to re-define this objectId method in every module. So, on top of the file, move the definition
          of the objectId method from rental.js to index.js:</p>
        Joi.objectId = require('joi-objectid')(Joi); <p>Now we load it once in index.js and then we can use it anywhere
        in our application. Don't forget to also add the code to load Joi:</p>
        const Joi = require('joi'); <p>We also need to modify models\movie.js. When creating a movie we need to pass a
        valid genreId so we replace the call to:</p>
        genreId: Joi.string().required(), <p>with:</p>
        genreId: Joi.objectId().required(), <p>One last change, before we finish this lecture, in our routes folder
        let's take a look at movies.js, specifically the route for creating a new movie:</p>
        router.post('/', async (req, res) => { const { error } = validate(req.body); if (error) return
        res.status(400).send(error.details[0].message);
        const genre = await Genre.findById(req.body.genreId); if (!genre) return res.status(400).send('Invalid genre.');
        let movie = new Movie({ title: req.body.title, genre: { _id: genre._id, name: genre.name }, numberInStock:
        req.body.numberInStock, dailyRentalRate: req.body.dailyRentalRate }); movie = await movie.save();
        res.send(movie); }); <p>Here we create a new movie object:</p>
        let movie = new Movie({ <p>Save it to the database:</p>
        movie = await movie.save(); <p>Then return it:</p>
        res.send(movie); <p>In this implementation I am resetting the movie after saving it to the database. This was
        purely to demonstrate that this save method returns a movie document. Also, I didn't want to distract with too
        much detail about how objectId's work.</p>
        <p>Now that you know that objectId's are actually generated by MongoDB driver, not MongoDB database, you'll also
          know that when we create a new movie object Mongoose talks to MongoDB driver and set's the id right here:</p>
        let movie = new Movie({ <p>Before saving this movie to the database. So technically we don't need to reset this
        movie in order to return that id to the client. So we can remove that:</p>
        await movie.save(); <p>and change movie from a variable:</p>
        let movie = new Movie({ <p>to a constant:</p>
        const movie = new Movie({ <p>The same principle applies when creating a new customer and a new genre.</p>
        <h3>123 - Recap</h3>
        <h4>Mongoose: Modelling Relationships between Connected Data</h4>
        <p>So, in this section, you learned that:</p>
        <p>To model relationships between connected data, we can either reference a document or embed it in another
          document. - When referencing a document, there is really no relationship between these two documents. So, it
          is possible to reference a non-existing document. - Referencing documents (normalization) is a good approach
          when you want to enforce data consistency. Because there will be a single instance of an object in the
          database. But this approach has a negative impact on the performance of your queries because in MongoDB we
          cannot JOIN documents as we do in relational databases. So, to get a complete representation of a document
          with its related documents, we need to send multiple queries to the database. - Embedding documents
          (denormalization) solves this issue. We can read a complete representation of a document with a single query.
          All the necessary data is embedded in one document and its children. But this also means we’ll have multiple
          copies of data in different places. While storage is not an issue these days, having multiple copies means
          changes made to the original document may not propagate to all copies. If the database server dies during an
          update, some documents will be inconsistent. For every business, for every problem, you need to ask this
          question: “can we tolerate data being inconsistent for a short period of time?” If not, you’ll have to use
          references. But again, this means that your queries will be slower.</p>
        // Referencing a document const courseSchema = new mongoose.Schema({ author: { type:
        mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: ‘Author’ } })
        // Embedding a document const courseSchema = new mongoose.Schema({ author: { type: new mongoose.Schema({ name:
        String, bio: String }) } }) <p>Embedded documents don’t have a save method. They can only be saved in the
        context of their parent.</p>
        // Updating an embedded document const course = await Course.findById(courseId); course.author.name = ‘New
        Name’; course.save(); <p>We don’t have transactions in MongoDB. To implement transactions, we use a pattern
        called “Two Phase Commit”. If you don’t want to manually implement this pattern, use the Fawn NPM package:</p>

        // Implementing transactions using Fawn try { await new Fawn.Task() .save(‘rentals’, newRental)
        .update(‘movies’, { _id: movie._id }, { $inc: numberInStock: -1 }}) .run(); } catch (ex) { // At this point, all
        operations are automatically rolled back } <p>ObjectIDs are generated by MongoDB driver and are used to uniquely
        identify a document. They consist of 12 bytes: - 4 bytes: timestamp - 3 bytes: machine identifier - 2 bytes:
        process identifier - 3 byes: counter</p>
        <p>ObjectIDs are almost unique. In theory, there is a chance for two ObjectIDs to be equal but the odds are very
          low (1/16,000,000) for most real-world applications.</p>
        // Validating ObjectIDs mongoose.Types.ObjectID.isValid(id); <p>To validate ObjectIDs using joi, use
        joi-objectid NPM package.</p>
