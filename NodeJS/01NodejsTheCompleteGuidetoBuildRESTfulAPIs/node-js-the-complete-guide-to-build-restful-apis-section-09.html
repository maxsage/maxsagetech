        <h3>112 - Modelling Relationships</h3>
        <p>So in all the examples we have looked at so far we have worked with single,
          self-contained documents. In the real world, the entities and concepts that we work with,
          they have some kind of association. For example, you can have a Course object or document
          and of course this course has an author. But the Author is more than just a name - it's
          more than just a simple string.</p>
        <p>You might have a collection of Authors where we store author documents. In each author
          document we could have properties like name, website, image etc. In this lecture we will
          discuss how to work with related objects. There are two approaches:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Using References (Normalization)</li>
          <li>Using Embedded Documents (De-normalization)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With the first approach, references, we have a separate collection for storing our
          Authors. So we can have an Author object like this:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let author = {
  name: 'Mosh'
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-001</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We can add various properties in the author object and then we would have a separate
          collection where we store course objects like this:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let course = {
  author: 'id'
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-002</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So here we have a course object. We set the author to the id of an author document in the
          authors collection. So here we are using a reference.</p>
        <p>For clarification, in relational databases, we have this concept of relationships which
          enforces data integrity. However in MongoDB or NoSQL databases in general, we don't really
          have a relationship. So even though I'm setting the ID of an author here there is actually
          no association or relationship between the author and course object in the database. This
          means it is possible to set the author's id property to something invalid and MonoDB
          doesn't care about that.</p>
        <p>Now we could take this example to the next level by saying that a course might have
          multiple authors. So instead of the author property we could have authors which we set to
          an array of references where we store multiple id's:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let course = {
  author: 'id',
  authors: [ 'id1', 'id2'
  ]
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-003</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>However, for simplicity, let's just work with a single author:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let course = {
  author: 'id'
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-004</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The other approach is to use embedded documents or de-normalization. We can embed an
          author document inside of a course document. So here we can have a course object or
          document and in this document we have the author property which we set to an object:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let course = {
  author: {
    name: 'Mosh'
  }
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-005</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The object will contain all the properties relevant to an Author. So we are embedding a
          document inside of another document. This is called de-normalization. If you have never
          worked with NoSQL databases before and you come from a relational database background, you
          may think that the first approach is the way to go. However, that is not necessarily the
          case when working with NoSQL databases - each approach has it's strength and weaknesses.
          What approach you choose really depends on your application and it's querying
          requirements.</p>
        <p>So basically, you need to do a trade-off between query performance versus consistency.
          With the first approach (references or normalization) you have a single place to define an
          author. If tomorrow, I decide to change the name of this author from Mosh to Mosh
          Hamedani, there is a single place that I need to modify. All courses that are referencing
          that author will automatically see the update.</p>
        <p>This means the first approach provides consistency. However, every time we want to query
          a course we need to do an extra query to load the related author. Sometimes that extra
          query may not be a big deal but in certain situations you might want to make sure a query
          runs as fast as possible. If that's the case you need to look at the second approach -
          using embedded documents.</p>
        <p>With this approach we can load a course object and it's author using a single query
          because the author is embedded inside the course object or the course document. However,
          with this approach, if tomorrow I decide to change the name of this author from Mosh to
          Mosh Hamedani then the chances are there will be multiple course documents that need to be
          updated. If our update operation doesn't complete successfully, it is possible that we wil
          have some course documents that are not updated. This will result in inconsistent
          data.</p>
        <p>So, in every part of your application, you will need to think about the queries that you
          will run ahead of time. You will design your database based on those queries.</p>
        <p>There is a third approach, known as the hybrid approach. Imagine, for example, that each
          author has 50 properties. We don't want duplicate all those properties inside every course
          in database. So we can have a separate collection of authors, but instead of using a
          reference here, we can embed an author document inside of a course document but not the
          complete representation for that author. So, with the hybrid approach, our database will
          look like this:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Hybrid
let author = {
  name: 'Mosh'
  // 50 other properties
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-006</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Now we have a separate collection of courses. In this collection we'll have course
          documents like this:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let course = {
  author: {
    id: 'ref',
    // Reference to an author document
    name: 'Mosh'
    // Only embed a subset of properties - not the complete representation of an author document
    }
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-007</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The id property is a reference to an author document. The name property is the name of
          the author as a string and is embedded into the course document. With this approach we can
          quickly read a course object, along with it's author, so we can optimize our query
          performance but we don't have to store all the properties of an author inside a course
          document.</p>
        <p>This approach is particularly useful if you want to have a snapshot of your data at a
          point in time. For example, imagine you were designing an e-commerce site. There we will
          have collections like orders, products, shopping carts and so on. In each order, we need
          to store the snapshot of a product, because we want to know the price of that product at a
          given point in time. That's where the hybrid approach is useful.</p>
        <p>So, again, which approach you use really depends on the application you are building -
          there is no right or wrong. Each approach has it's strength and weaknesses.</p>
        <h3>113 - Referencing Documents</h3>
        <p>In this lecture, we will discuss how to reference a document in another document. The
          demo code contains two modules. The first is author with three properties:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>name</li>
          <li>bio</li>
          <li>website</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The other is course with one property:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            name
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this lecture we will add another property - author where we will reference an author
          document. We also have a few helper functions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>createAuthor</li>
          <li>createCourse</li>
          <li>listCourses</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All these functions are similar to what you have seen earlier in this section - so there
          is nothing new here.</p>
        <p>Now before getting started go to MongoDB compass and delete the playground database so we
          can start on a clean canvas.</p>
        <p>At the bottom of index.js you can see we have a call to the creatAuthor function.</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code
            class="language-javascript">createAuthor('Mosh', 'My bio', 'My Website');</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-008</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Run the application:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-009.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-009</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So we created one Author - you can see the id above. Now let's copy this and then back in
          the code comment out the call to createAuthor and enable createCourse pasting in the id
          from above:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">createCourse('Node Course', '5c33787f925b1d69c861529e');</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-010</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>If you look at the implementation of this function we create a course object with two
          properties:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>name</li>
          <li>author</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Save the file, and back in the terminal run the application again:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-011.png"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-011</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This has created a course object - you can see the id and name above but we don't have an
          author. The reason for this is because when we defined this course model we only added the
          name property:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const Course = mongoose.model('Course', new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String
}));</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-012</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So when saving a course object, only the properties that you have defined in your model
          will be persisted in the database. So here, in our model, we need to add another property
          author:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const Course = mongoose.model('Course', new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  author: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Author'
  }
}));</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-013</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We set this to a schema type object. The type of this property should be ObjectId. So we
          use mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId. We also set a property called ref and specify the
          target collection - Author. In the author property we will store an ObjectId that
          references an author document. However, once again, we don't really have a proper
          relationship here. We can store a course with an invalid author, and Mongo doesn't
          complain about that.</p>
        <p>So now have modified the model run the application again:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-014.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-014</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>we now have the author property. Now, back in MongoDB compass, let's look at this
          playground database and our courses collection:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-015.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-015</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>You can see we have two documents. The first one doesn't have an author, but the second
          one does.</p>
        <h3>114 - Population</h3>
        <p>In this lecture, we will get all the courses along with their Authors. Let's enable the
          call to listCourses():</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">listCourses();</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-016</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In this function:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">async function listCourses() {
  const courses = await Course
    .find()
    .select('name author -_id');
  console.log(courses);
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-016</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We are calling the find method to get all the courses and we're selecting only their name
          property. Save the changes and run the application.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-017.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-017</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We only get _id and name in the results. If we add author:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">async function listCourses() {
  const courses = await Course
    .find()
    .select('name author');
  console.log(courses);
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-018</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>And run the program again. We get the following results:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-019.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-019</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Our second document now has an author. We are only getting the reference or the object id
          here. In a real world application, you want to load this author document so we can display
          it's name. That's where we can call the populate method:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">async function listCourses() {
  const courses = await Course
    .find()
    .populate('author')
    .select('name author');
  console.log(courses);
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-020</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>As the first argument we specify the path to a given property - in this case author. And
          because earlier, when defining the course model, we set author to be an ObjectId and we
          referenced the Author collection:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const Course = mongoose.model('Course', new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  author: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Author'
  }
}));</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-021</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>When we load a course object and populate the author property, Mongoose knows that it
          should query the authors collection in MongoDB. Run the application:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-022.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-022</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Our first document doesn't have an author so we don't get anything. Our second course
          does have an author and we can see a complete representation of an author document. In a
          real world application, an author can have multiple properties. Perhaps when showing a
          list of courses, we don't want to get all the additional properties of the author - maybe
          you just want to get the name property.</p>
        <p>We can achieve this by supplying a second argument to the populate method which specifies
          the properties you want to include or exclude:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">.populate('author', 'name -_id')</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-023</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This will exclude the _id property. If you run the application again:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-024.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-024</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Now the author property only contains the name property. It's also possible to use the
          populate method to populate multiple properties. For example, let's imagine that each
          course has a category and the category references the category document. So here we can
          call populate again, add category, and optionally pick only the name property of each
          category document:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">async function listCourses() {
  const courses = await Course
    .find()
    .populate('author', 'name -_id')
    .populate('category', 'name')
    .select('name author');
  console.log(courses);
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-025</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>One last thing to finish the lecture. Earlier we discussed how Mongo doesn't have
          relationships or data integrity in our database. So here in our courses collection it is
          possible to set our author to an invalid document. You can use Compass to simulate this by
          manually editing the ObjectId of the author property:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-026.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-026</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>MongoDB allows you to make this modification without complaining. If you run the
          application:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-027.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-027</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>You can see the author is now null because there is no author with the given id in our
          database.</p>
        <h3>115 - Embedding Documents</h3>
        <p>So in the last lecture you learned how to use references to relate documents. In this
          lecture we are going to look at another technique which is embedding documents.</p>
        <p>Here we have the authorSchema exactly as it was in the previous lecture:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const authorSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  bio: String,
  website: String
});</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-028</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>With three properties:
        <ul>
          <li>name</li>
          <li>bio</li>
          <li>website</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We have an Author model:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const Author = mongoose.model('Author', authorSchema);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-029</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Below that we have the Course model:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const Course = mongoose.model('Course', new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String
}));</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-030</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Here we don't have the Author property. That's what we are going to add in this lecture.
          In the last lecture we set the type of our author property to an ObjectId and referenced
          the Author collection:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const Course = mongoose.model('Course', new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  author: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Author'
  }
}));</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-031</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In this lecture we are going to embed an author document directly inside of the course
          document:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const Course = mongoose.model('Course', new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  author: {
    type: authorSchema
  }
}));</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-032</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We set the type of the author property to authorSchema which is defined here:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const authorSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  bio: String,
  website: String
});</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-033</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>That is the only change we need to make. Now let's take a look at the createCourse
          function:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">async function createCourse(name, author) {
  const course = new Course({
    name, author
  });

  const result = await course.save();
  console.log(result);
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-034</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We take a course name and an author, initialize the course and save it, as we did
          previously.</p>
        <p>At the end of the file we have a call to the createCourse function:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">createCourse('Node Course', new Author({ name: 'Mosh' }));</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-035</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Before going any further open MongoDB Compass and delete the playground database. We want
          to start on a clean canvas to make sure we are on the same page.</p>
        <p>Run the application:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-036.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-036</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>You can see the new course document. We can see author is an object with two properties -
          id and name. So this is an embedded or sub-document. These sub-documents are like normal
          documents so most features that are available in normal documents are also available in
          sub documents. For example, we can implement validation here, we can enforce that
          author.name should be required.</p>
        <p>However, these sub-documents, cannot be created on their own. They can only be saved in
          the context of their parent. So let's say I want to change the name of this author. Copy
          the course id. Create a new function:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">async function updateAuthor(courseId) {
  const course = await Course.findById(courseId);
  course.author.name = 'Mosh Hamedani';
  course.save();
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-037</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>First we find a course with the given id. Then, we modify the author and call
          course.save().</p>

        <p>Bear in mind we don't have course.author.save() - that does not exist.</p>
        <p>Let's add a call to this function:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code
            class="language-javascript">updateAuthor('5ac4da76334f0d2cf09211e5');</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-038</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Run the application again. To check the document has been updated look at Compass.
          Refresh the view then browse the playground database, courses collection, course document,
          author property. You should see the author name has been updated:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-039.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-039</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We can also update a sub-document directly. So, instead of querying it first, we can
          update it directly in the database:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">async function updateAuthor(courseId) {
  const course = await Course.update({ _id: courseId}, {
    $set: {
      'author.name': 'John Smith'
    }
  });
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-040</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We replace findById with update passing a query object as the first argument. The second
          argument is our update object. We use the set operator, which we have seen before, which
          we set to an object. Here we pass one or more key/value pairs. To access the a nested
          property we use the dot notation. Let's say we want to update the name of the author of a
          course:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">'author.name': 'John Smith'</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-041</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>With this we don't need to modify this object in memory and save it explicitly. We update
          it directly in the database. So back in the terminal run the application again. Go into
          Compass and refresh. You should see the author name has been updated:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-042.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-042</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>If you want to remove the sub-document you use the unset operator:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">async function updateAuthor(courseId) {
  const course = await Course.update({ _id: courseId}, {
    $unset: {
      'author': ''
    }
  });
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-043</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We can specify author.name to remove the nested property or we can specify author to
          remove the sub-document as a whole (as in the code above)</p>
        <p>As discussed previously, these sub-documents are similar to normal documents, so here we
          can enforce validation. We can enforce that every course should have an author, so here's
          the definition of our course schema:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const Course = mongoose.model('Course', new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  author: authorSchema
  }
));</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-044</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We make this author property required by passing a Schema type object and setting the
          type to authorSchema and the required property to true:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const Course = mongoose.model('Course', new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  author: { type: authorSchema, required: true }
}));</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-045</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This syntax is identical to the validation we looked at in the section on Mongoose data
          validation. If you want to make a specific property in the author document required you
          apply that validation on the author sub-document itself:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const authorSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  bio: String,
  website: String
});</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-046</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We specify a schema type object and set the required property to true.</p>
        <h3>116 - Using an Array of Sub-documents</h3>
        <p>So in the last lecture we add an author as a sub-document in the course document. In this
          lecture, I'm going to show you how to change this to an array of sub-documents.</p>
        <p>First rename the property to authors, then change it's value to an array of
          authorSchema:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const Course = mongoose.model('Course', new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  authors: [authorSchema]
}));</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-047</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We need to modify the createCourse function so that when creating an array we pass an
          array of authors:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">async function createCourse(name, authors) {
  const course = new Course({
    name,
    authors
});</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-048</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Finally, in the call to createCourse, instead of passing one author object we pass an
          array:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">createCourse('Node Course', [
  new Author({ name: 'Mosh' }),
  new Author({ name: 'John'})
]);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-049</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Now back in Compass delete the courses collection. Run the application:</p>
        <p>In Compass refresh and look at the new document that has been created in the courses
          collection:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-050.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-050</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>You can see the courses collection and the course document with an array of authors.
          Every Author is an object and when you expand you see two properties _id and name.</p>
        <p>We can add authors to this array at a later date if required. Back in the code, let's
          create a new function called addAuthor:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">async function addAuthor(courseId, author) {
  const course = await Course.findById(courseId);
  course.authors.push(author);
  course.save();
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-051</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>First we find a course, then we push the author into the authors array. At this point our
          changes are not saved to the database so we call course.save.</p>
        <p>Add a call to the addAuthor function:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code
            class="language-javascript">addAuthor('5c361a1ad2643c0ab0b82381', new Author({ name: 'Amy'}));</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-052</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Run the application and check in Compass to ensure the new Author has been successfully
          added to the array.</p>
        <p>Removing an Author is very similar:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">async function removeAuthor(courseId, authorId) {
  const course = await Course.findById(courseId);
  const author = course.authors.id(authorId);
  author.remove();
  course.save();
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-053</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We supply two parameters - courseId and authorId. We use the findById method to find the
          course. Next we use dot notation to goto course.authors and here we have an id method. The
          id method can be used to lookup a child object by it's id. So we pass the authorId and
          store the returned author object in a const called author. Now we can call the remove
          method on the author object. Finally we call course.save();</p>
        <p>Add a call to the removeAuthor function:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code
            class="language-javascript">removeAuthor('5c361a1ad2643c0ab0b82381', '5c361cafe15b1105e4afb80a');</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-054</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Run the application and take a look at the data in Compass:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-055.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-055</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The specified author should have been removed.</p>
        <p>This is how we work with sub-documents.</p>
        <h3>117 - Project - Build the Movies API</h3>
        <p>Alright now, I want to get back to our vidly project, and build an API to manage the list
          of movies. Now, don't think that this is exactly like managing the list of genres, this
          exercise is more challenging.</p>
        <p>So this is the shape of the movies that we want to store in MongoDB:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>title: String</li>
          <li>genre: An embedded genre object</li>
          <li>numberInStock: Number</li>
          <li>dailyRentalRate: Number</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that the vidly database already contains a genres collection but we are embedding
          genre documents inside a movie document to optimize the performance of our queries. Also,
          take into account, that it's very unlikely that we will rename the name of a genre in the
          future - sci-fi is sci-fi, thriller is thriller so in this particular case, I'm not
          worried about our data becoming inconsistent in the future.</p>
        <p>You might be curious why we still need a separate genres collection. Somewhere in our
          application on the client side you may want to have a drop-down list that allows the user
          to select the genre for a movie. For this reason, we will keep the genres collection -
          querying this collection is much easier than querying all the movies and then getting the
          unique list of genres.</p>
        <p>To save time we wont type the solution out by hand. You can download it as a zip file
          attached to this lecture. Here we will just highlight the key points that are important to
          understand.</p>
        <p>Let's start with our movie model and the Movie schema:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const Movie = mongoose.model('Movies', new mongoose.Schema({
  title: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    trim: true,
    minlength: 5,
    maxlength: 255
  },
  genre: {
    type: genreSchema,
    required: true
  },
  numberInStock: {
    type: Number,
    required: true,
    min: 0,
    max: 255
  },
  dailyRentalRate: {
    type: Number,
    required: true,
    min: 0,
    max: 255
  }
}));</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-056</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We have a title property which is a string that is required. trimming is also enabled to
          get rid of any paddings around the title of the movie. I set the minimum length to five
          characters and the maximum length to 255 characters. This is because I don't want a
          malicious client to send a very long string t hat could potentially cause problems in our
          application.</p>
        <p>Next we have genre. I have set the type of this genre to genreSchema. In the code above
          the model definition you can see we have created a genreSchema constant and loaded it from
          our genre module:</p>
        <figure>
        <pre><code
          class="language-javascript">const { genreSchema } = require('./genre');</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-057</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The genreSchema is defined in a file called genre.js. Previously we didn't define the
          genreSchema separately. Instead it was defined directly in the call to mongoose.model.
          However, because we need to reference the genreSchema in our movie module it has been
          extracted into a separate constant that can be reused in multiple places:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const genreSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    minlength: 5,
    maxlength: 50
  }
});</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-058</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Also at the end of the genre module we add the genreSchema to our module.exports:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">exports.genreSchema = genreSchema;</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-059</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So back in the Movie module, next we have the numberInStock property which is a required
          number:</p>
        <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">numberInStock: {
  type: Number,
  required: true,
  min: 0,
  max: 255
},</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-060</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The min is set to 0 because we don't want to end up with a negative number here. This
          kind of validation ensures our application behaves properly. We also set a maximum of 255
          character. Again this is to prevent a malicious client to sending a very large number that
          could potentially cause problems in our application.</p>
        <p>The same is true for the last property dailyRentalRate:</p>
        <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">dailyRentalRate: {
    type: Number,
    required: true,
    min: 0,
    max: 255
  }</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-061</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Below the definition of our Schema and model we have our validateMovie function. This is
          where we define our Joi schema:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">function validateMovie(movie) {
  const schema = {
    title: Joi.string().min(5).max(50).required(),
    genreId: Joi.string().required(),
    numberInStock: Joi.number().min(0).required(),
    dailyRentalRate: Joi.number().min(0).required()
};</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-062</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This is different to our Mongoose schema. Note that our Joi schema has a property called
          genreId not genre because we want the client to send only the Id of a genre. Therefore the
          genreId is set to a string that is required.</p>
        <p>In contrast in our Mongoose schema we have genre:</p>
        <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">genre: {
  type: genreSchema,
  required: true
},</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-063</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Which is a complex object. So you can see that in a real world application your Mongoose
          Schema can start to grow independent of your Joi Schema.</p>
        <p>The Joi schema validates what the client sends us - the input to our API. The Mongoose
          Schema is a representation of our model in the application. That's our persistence model,
          that's what we're store as a document in MongoDB.</p>
        <p>So that covers our movie module. Now let's take a look at our movies routes. We will
          overview just one route here - the one that calls the post method to create a new
          movie:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">router.post('/', async (req, res) =&gt; {
  const { error } = validate(req.body);
  if (error) return res.status(400).send(error.details[0].message);

  const genre = await Genre.findById(req.body.genreId);
  if (!genre) return res.status(400).send('Invalid genre.');

  let movie = new Movie({
    title: req.body.title,
    genre: {
      _id: genre._id,
      name: genre.name
    },
    numberInStock: req.body.numberInStock,
    dailyRentalRate: req.body.dailyRentalRate
  });
  movie = await movie.save();

  res.send(movie);
});</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-064</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>At the top we validate the object that we send in the request, if it's invalid we return
          a 400 error which is bad request (as we did before). After that we have something new. We
          use findById to find a genre. If it doesn't exist we return the 400 error with the message
          'Invalid genre.'. This makes sure that the genreId that the client sends represents a
          valid genre.</p>
        <p>Below that we create the movie object. We set the title based on what we get in the
          request but for genre we set the value to a complex object with two properties - _id and
          name. We read both of these from the genre. You might ask why I didn't send this genre to
          the genre objected that we loaded in the code nearer the top of the post method:</p>
        <figure>
        <pre><code
          class="language-javascript">const genre = await Genre.findById(req.body.genreId);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-065</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The reason we don't do that is that, is because this genre object, also has a version
          property that is set by Mongo which we dont want in movie.genre. Also, in a more complex
          application, the object that we load when we call Genre.findById may have 50 properties.
          We don't want to store all those properties when embedding the genre document in the movie
          document. That's why we selectively set the properties.</p>
        <p>The rest of the code in the vidly application, as it currently stands, is pretty self
          explanatory.</p>
        <h3>118 - Project - Build the Rentals API</h3>
        <p>So far we have built APIs to manage customer, genres and movies. Now let's take this
          application to the next level.</p>
        <p>I want you to implement an API to manage the rentals:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a new rental: POST /api/rentals</li>
          <li>Get the list of rentals: GET /api/rentals</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>In the models folder we have a new module rental. Let's take a look at the schema:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const Rental = mongoose.model('Rental', new mongoose.Schema({
  customer: {
    type: new mongoose.Schema({
      name: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        minlength: 5,
        maxlength: 50
      },

          <figcaption>Fig 09-066</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          We have a customer property with the type set to a custom schema that is defined here:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code
            class="language-javascript">customer: { type: new mongoose.Schema({</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-067</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In other words I am not reusing the customer Schema we defined in the customer module.
          The reason for this is that because our customer can have 50 properties. We don't want to
          have all those properties inside the Rental object. We only need the primary properties
          that we need when displaying the list of rentals. So we have:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>name</li>
          <li>isGold - perhaps we want to give a discount to our gold customers</li>
          <li>phone - when we look at a list or rentals or a single rental it might be handy to have
            contact information for this customer
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>You might ask, what if in the future we need to display more information about this
          customer on the rental page. Here we will have the id of the customer as well so for
          anything additional we can always send a GET request to our customer API to get a complete
          representation of our customer.</p>
        <p>By the same token we have a movie property set to a custom schema:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">movie: { type: new mongoose.Schema({</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-067</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We have not re-used the movie Schema that we defined in movie.js. This is for the same
          reason as before - our movie may have 50 properties and we don't want to add them all
          here. So for a rental object or rental document, we only need the title of the movie and
          dailyRentalRate because in the future we are going to use this to calculate the rental
          fee. If we include this in an embedded document we don't need and additional query for the
          movies collection to calculate the rental fee.</p>
        <p>Note that both the customer and the movie are marked as required:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">required: true </code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-068</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We have another property that is called dateOut:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code
            class="language-javascript">dateOut: { type: Date, required: true, default: Date.now },</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-069</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>It's a date, it's required and the default value for this property is the current
          date/time.</p>
        <p>We also need another property called dateReturned:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">dateReturned: { type: Date },</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-070</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This is also a date but it's not required because initially we don't have a value for
          this property and then in the future when this customer returns a movie we will set this
          value.</p>
        <p>The last property is rentalFee:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">rentalFee: { type: Number, min: 0 }</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-071</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>which is a number that cannot be less than zero.</p>
        <p>So this is the shape of our rental documents in MongoDB.</p>
        <p>Next we have the validateRental function:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">function validateRental(rental) {
    const schema = {
    customerId: Joi.string().required(),
    movieId: Joi.string().required()
  };

  return Joi.validate(rental, schema);
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-072</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Note that the schema we have here is very different to the schema we defined in our
          rental documents in MongoDB. Here we have only two properties - customerId and MovieId.
          These are the properties that the client sends to the server because we don't want the
          client to set the dateOut property. This should be set on the server based on the current
          date/time. By the same toke we don't want the client to set dateReturned or rentalFee.
          These should be set on the server. So, when creating a new rental, the client should send
          only two values - customerId and movieId.</p>
        <p>Now let's take a look at the API implementation in routes\rentals.js.</p>
        <p>We have an endpoint to get the list of rentals:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">router.get('/', async (req, res) =&gt; {
  const rentals = await Rental.find().sort('-dateOut');
  res.send(rentals);
});</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-073</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Very simple - just like before except that here we are sorting by dateOut in a descending
          order. That's why we have the minus sign.</p>
        <p>Now let's take a look at our other route for creating a new rental. First we validate the
          request:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const { error } = validate(req.body);
  if (error) return res.status(400).send(error.details[0].message);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-074</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>If it's not valid we send a 400 error. After that we want to make sure that the customer
          id that the client is sending us is a valid customer. That's why here we find the customer
          by id:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const customer = await Customer.findById(req.body.customerId);
if (!customer) return res.status(400).send('Invalid customer.');</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-075</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>If we don't find the customer we respond with a 400 error and say this is an invalid
          customer.</p>
        <p>By the same token, we need to validate the movie id that the client sends us. We find the
          movie and if it doesn't exist we return a 400 error:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">const movie = await Movie.findById(req.body.movieId);
if (!movie) return res.status(400).send('Invalid movie.');</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-076</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We also want to make sure that the movie we are renting out is in stock. So, if
          numberInStock is 0 we return a 400 error:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">if (movie.numberInStock === 0)
  return res.status(400).send('Movie not in stock.');</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-077</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>After this point everything is valid so we create a new rental object:</p>
        <figure>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">let rental = new Rental({
  customer: {
    _id: customer._id,
    name: customer.name,
    phone: customer.phone
  },
  movie: {
    _id: movie._id,
    title: movie.title,
    dailyRentalRate: movie.dailyRentalRate
  }
});

rental = await rental.save();</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-078</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We set the customer object to a complex object with the _id, name and phone properties.
          We store the _id here because perhaps in the future we want more information about the
          customer that is not available in the rental document so we can query the customer
          later.</p>
        <p>Similarly we have the movie property which is a complex object with three properties -
          _id, title and dailyRentalRate. Note that here, we have not set the dateOut property. This
          is because earlier we defined the property to have a default value of the current
          date/time. So when we save this rental Mongoose will automatically set that property.</p>
        <p>After that we update the numberInStock property of the movie then save:</p>
        <figure>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">movie.numberInStock--;
        movie.save();</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-079</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Here, we have a problem. There are two separate operations. It is possible that after we
          save the rental something goes wrong, maybe our server crashes, or connection to MongoDB
          drops meaning that perhaps the second operation - movie.save() will not complete.</p>
        <p>That's where we need a transaction. With a transaction we can ensure that both these
          operations will update the state of our data in the database or none of them will be
          applied. So they are atomic - they both complete or the both roll back. Now in a lot of
          relational databases we have the concept of transactions. In MongoDB, we don't really have
          transactions.</p>
        <p>There is a technique that is called two phase commit which is beyond the scope of this
          course. In the next lecture, however, we will look at an npm package that simulates a
          transaction in Mongoose.</p>
        <h3>119 - Transactions</h3>
        <p>In some relational database like SQL server or MySQL we have the concept of transaction
          which basically means a group of operations that should be performed as a unit:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-080.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-080</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p> So either all these operations will complete and change the state of the database or, if
          something fails at some point, all these operations that have been applied will be rolled
          back and our database will go back to it's initial state.</p>
        <p>Now, in MongoDB we don't have transactions as we have in these relational databases. We
          have a technique called two phase commit, which you can learn more about at:</p>
        <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/perform-two-phase-commits/">Two phase
          commits</a>
        <p>This document clearly explains how to perform two phase commits using a real world
          example.</p>
        <p>Now, in this lecture, I'm going to introduce you to a library that uses the concept of
          transaction, but internally it implements this transaction using the two phase commit. So,
          back in the terminal, let's install fawn:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-command">npm i fawn</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-081</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The version I had installed was 2.1.5. In routes\rentals.js first we need to load
          fawn:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const Fawn = require('fawn');</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-082</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This a class with an initialize method that we need to call:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">Fawn.init(mongoose);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-083</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Back in the post method where we create a rental object:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">let rental = new Rental({</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-084</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We are no longer going to create the rental and update the movie explicitly. Instead we
          are going to create a task object which is like a transaction. So delete these three
          lines:</p>
        <figure>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">rental = await rental.save();
movie.numberInStock--;
movie.save(); </code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-085</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>New up a Fawn task:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">new Fawn.Task()</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-086</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Here we can add one more operations. All these operations together will be treated as a
          unit. So we want to save the new rental to the rentals collection:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">new Fawn.Task()
  .save('rentals', rental)</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-087</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Note that here you are working directly with the collection. That's why we need to pass
          the actual name of the collection, which is plural, not singular, and also note that this
          name is case sensitive. If you look in Compass you will see the name of the collections
          are all lowercase:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-088.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-088.PNG</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This is our first operation - saving the rental.</p>
        <p>As part of this unit we also want to update the movies collection. Here, as the second
          arugment, we pass a query object to determine the movie, or movies that should be updated.
          The third argument is our update object. Here we use the increment operator setting the
          value to an object. The target property you want to update is numberInStock. We want to
          decrement this property by -1:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">.update('movies', { _id: movie._id },
  { $inc: { numberInStock: -1 }
})</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-089</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So we have defined two operations:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">.save('rentals', rental)
.update('movies', { _id: movie._id },
  { $inc: { numberInStock: -1 }
})</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-090</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Maybe in your application, as part of performing this transaction, you want to remove a
          document somewhere else. So we could add another operation .remove You can read more about
          Fawn on their GitHub page documentation.</p>
        <p>So, after we chain all these operations, finally you need to call run():</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">new Fawn.Task()
  .save('rentals', rental)
  .update('movies', { _id: movie._id },
    { $inc: { numberInStock: -1 }
  })
  .run();</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-091</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>If you don't call run then none of the operations will be performed. Now, it's possible
          that something fails during this transaction so we need to wrap this in a try\catch
          block:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">try {
  new Fawn.Task()
    .save('rentals', rental)
    .update('movies', { _id: movie._id },
      { $inc: { numberInStock: -1 }
    })
    .run();

    res.send(rental);
  }
  catch(ex) {
    res.status(500).send('Something failed.');
  }
});</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-092</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>If something fails we catch the exception and return a 500 error to the client which
          means internal server error. In a real world application at this point you want to log
          this exception so later you can come back and see what went wrong. We are going to have a
          separate section in the course about error handling and logging so for now don't worry
          about it.</p>
        <p>In MongoDB Compass delete the rentals collection. Run the application:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">nodemon</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-093</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Back in Compass look at the movies collection:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-093.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-093.PNG</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Here we have a movie with numberInStock of 8. We will create a new rental and then check
          the numberInStock has decremented by 1 to 7.</p>
        <p>In Postman send a post request to our rentals endpoint:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-command">http://localhost:3000/api/rentals</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-094</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In the body of the request I have a valid customerId and movieId:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-095.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-095</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Let's send this and our response should be:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-096.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-096</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We can see dateOut, id, customer and movie.</p>
        <p>Now, back in the Compass, in the movies collection refresh the list and you should see
          the number in stock drops to 7:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-097.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-097</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So this verifies that our transaction completed successfully.</p>
        <p>A question for you - In our post method we create our rental object</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let rental = new Rental({
  customer: {
    _id: customer._id,
    name: customer.name,
    phone: customer.phone
  },
  movie: {
    _id: movie._id,
    title: movie.title,
    dailyRentalRate: movie.dailyRentalRate
  }
});</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-098</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We only set customer and movie. Then in our try block we create the Fawn task, run it
          then send the rental object to the client. In this code we didn't set the id or dateOut
          property but in the body of the response we can see both the properties are set:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-099.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-099</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So how did this happen?</p>
        <p>You might expect that MongoDB set the dateOut and id properties but in MongoDB we don't
          have these default values. We define them in our mongoose Schema. So when we create a new
          rental object:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">let rental = new Rental({</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-100</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Mongoose knows the Schema for this object, it looks at various properties and sets the
          default values. The same is true for the _id properties, MongoDB doesn't set this. The _id
          property is set before we save the document to the database. I didn't tell you this
          earlier because I didn't want confuse your with too many details.</p>
        <p>We will cover more about id in the next lecture. Let's look at one more thing before we
          finish this lecture. Back in Compass click the refresh collections button and you will see
          a new collection ojlinttaskcollections:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-101.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-101</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So where did that come from? The Fawn library that we installed uses that collection to
          perform two phase commits. When we run the Fawn task it adds a new document to that
          collection that represents our transaction. Then it will execute each of the operations in
          the task independently then finally , when all the operations are complete, it will delete
          the document from the collection.</p>
        <h3>120 - ObjectId</h3>
        <p>In this lecture we are going to look at object id's in MongoDB. You may have noticed that
          when you store a document in MongoDB it sets the value of the _id property to a long
          string like this:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-command">// _id: 5ac4aa5307ac0119b0e74255</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-102</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Here we have 24 characters where every two characters represent a byte. So essentially we
          have 12 bytes to uniquely identify a document in MongoDB. The twelve bytes are used in the
          following way:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>4 bytes: timestamp - The time this document was created.</li>
          <li>3 bytes: machine identifier - Two different machines will have two different
            identifiers.
          </li>
          <li>3 bytes: process identifier - If you generate two object id's on the same machine but
            in different processes these two bytes will be different.
          </li>
          <li>3 bytes: counter - If your on the same machine, in the same process at the same second
            but generate two different documents the counter bytes will be different
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Also, because a timestamp is included in the _id property, there is no need to create a
          separate property or document like createdAt. By the same token, if you want to sort your
          documents based on the creation time you can simply sort them by the id property.</p>
        <p>So with these twelve bytes we can uniquely identify the document in MongoDB. Having said
          that there is a very, very small chance that we will generate two object id's that are the
          same. Let's see how that can happen.</p>
        <p>You know that, in each byte, we have 8 bits and each bit holds either 0 or 1. So how many
          numbers can we represent?</p>
        <figure>
        <pre><code class="language-command">1 byte = 8 bits
2 ^ 8 = 256</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-103</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So with one byte we can store 256 different numbers. Now, as discussed, the last three
          bytes represent a counter. This is like the counter that you have probably seen in SQL
          Server, MySQL or other databases. So how many numbers can we store in 3 bytes:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-command">1 byte = 8 bits
2 ^ 8 = 256
2 ^ 24 = 16M</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-104</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So, if have the same second, on the same machine, in the same process and we generate
          more than 16M documents the counter bytes will overflow and that's where we will end up
          with two documents with the same object id. However, this is a very unlikely scenario for
          many applications out there. All we need to remember is the object id is almost unique but
          not 100 percent.</p>
        <p>Now you might be curious as to why we don't have a mechanism in MongoDB that guarantees
          uniqueness. For example, in database management systems like SQL server or My SQL, in each
          table we have an auto incrementing number that guarantees uniqueness. So next time we
          store a course record in our database the id of that course will be the id of the course
          plus 1. This approach guarantees the uniqueness of this identifier but it hurts
          scalability.</p>
        <p>In MongoDB the id we have here:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-command">_id: 5ac4aa5307ac0119b0e74255</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-105</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Is not generated by MongoDB itself. It is actually generated by MongoDB driver. So we
          have the MongoDB driver that talks to MongoDB. Because the id is generated by the driver,
          it means, we don't have to wait for MongoDB to generate a new unique identifier.</p>
        <p>That's why applications built on top of MongoDB are highly scalable. You can have several
          instances of MongoDB and we don't have to talk to a central place to get a unique
          identifier. The driver itself can generate an almost unique identifier using the twelve
          bytes we discussed above.</p>
        <p>So, when you build an application with Node and Express, you use Mongoose. As I told you
          before, Mongoose is an abstraction over MongoDB driver, so when you create a new
          object/document Mongoose talks to MongoDB driver to generate a new id, but it can also
          explicitly generate an id if you want to. Let's see how to do this.</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const id = new mongoose.Types.ObjectId();
console.log(id);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-106</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We call the getTimestamp() method that belongs to the object id:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const id = new mongoose.Types.ObjectId();
console.log(id.getTimestamp());</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-106</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Run the application:</p>
        <p>You can see the time we generated this Object Id:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-107.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-107</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We also have a static method on this ObjectId class for validating object ids:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const isValid = mongoose.Types.ObjectId.isValid('1234');
console.log(isValid);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-108</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Obviously this is not a valid object id so when we run the application we see:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-109.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-109</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>121 - Validating Object ID's</h3>
        <p>Back to our vidly application. In Postman we are going to send a POST request to our
          rentals endpoint:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-command">http://localhost:3000/api/rentals</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-110</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In the body of the request we have a valid customerId and movieId:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-111.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-111</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Now let see what happens if we change the customerId object id in the body of the request
          to a value like 1234:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-112.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-112</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Run the application and send the request in Postman. Postman hangs and in the terminal
          you see the following error:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-113.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-113</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This basically means we had a promise that was rejected but we didn't handle it properly.
          Now as I told you before we have a separate section about error handling and logging in
          the course so let's not worry about that part. Instead look at the error:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-command">CastError: Cast to ObjectId failed for value &quot;1234&quot; at path &quot;_id&quot; for model &quot;Customer&quot;</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-114</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So let's talk through the message to simplify it. We are talking about the Customer model
          and we are talking about the id property. In the error message you see the word path which
          represents a chain of properties. For example, a customer can have address, address can
          have street etc. So that's why we use path. Mongoose is complaining that it can't cast the
          value 1234 to ObjectId. Obviously, this is because, 1234 is not a valid ObjectId.</p>
        <p>The issue we have in our implementation is that we are not seeing a response from the
          POST request - We are getting a message in terminal</p>
        <p>In the situation where we send an invalid customerId we should receive a 400 error - bad
          request because the server cannot fulfill this request.</p>
        <p>Back in routes/rentals.js look at the handler for creating a new rental:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">router.post('/', async (req, res) =&gt; {
  const { error } = validate(req.body);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-115</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>At the top we validate the request. This ensures that we have a customerId and a movieId
          but it doesn't check if these values are valid object id's. The exception that we saw
          above is thrown by this line:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const customer = await Customer.findById(req.body.customerId);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-116</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>When we call findById on the Customer class, if we pass an invalid object id we get the
          exception.</p>
        <p>One way to fix the problem is to add an if statement to check the type is valid:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">if(!mongoose.Types.ObjectId.isValid(req.body.customerId))
  return res.status(400).send('Invalid customer.');</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-117</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          If the customerId is not a valid ObjectId we return an error 400. We would also have to
          check the movieId. However this is a bad implementation because earlier we defined this
          function to validate our request:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">validate(req.body);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-118</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So the logic to check for valid object id's really belongs in the function above. So we
          would check to make sure that the customerId is a string, that has a value and is a valid
          ObjectId. If the input is in the right shape only then should we go to the database to
          find the Customer.</p>
        <p>Go back to the validateRental function in models\rental.js:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function validateRental(rental) {
  const schema = {
    customerId: Joi.string().required(),
    movieId: Joi.string().required()
  };

  return Joi.validate(rental, schema);
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-119</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Here we need to add validation because we need to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Talk to Mongoose</li>
          <li>Call the isValid method of ObjectId.Type</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now, extending the validation is a little bit complex and you don't want to repeat that
          every time you need a validate function. There is actually an npm package for adding
          support to validating ObjectId's in Joi. So, back in the terminal:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-command">npm i joi-objectid</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-120</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The current version that get's installed is 2.0.0. Back in rental.js we need to load this
          module:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code
            class="language-javascript">Joi.objectId = require('joi-objectid')(Joi); </code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-121</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>require('joi-objectid') returns a function. We call the function and return a reference
          to the Joi module defined above:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const Joi = require('joi');
require('joi-objectid')(Joi);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-122</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The result of this is a function so we can set Joi.objectId to this function:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">Joi.objectId = require('joi-objectid')(Joi);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-123</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>objectId is a method on the Joi object. Back in the validateRental function we will
          change the definition of the customerId from Joi.string() to Joi.objectId() which is the
          method that we defined at the top of the module. We make the same change for the
          movieId:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function validateRental(rental) {
  const schema = {
    customerId: Joi.objectId().required(),
    movieId: Joi.objectId().required()
  };

  return Joi.validate(rental, schema);
}</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-124</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Now, back in the terminal, let's run the application again:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-command">nodemon</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-125</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In Postman send another POST request with an invalid customerId. You should see the
          following:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/Fig09-126.PNG"/>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-126</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>You should also receive a 400 - Bad Request. The Terminal should now also not be showing
          the unhandled promise rejection.</p>
        <h3>122 - A Better Implementation</h3>
        <p>Back in rental.js it is likely that we will use the Joi.objectId() method in other places
          in our application, like in the movie module or the customer module.</p>
        <p>We don't want to re-define this objectId method in every module. So, on top of the file,
          move the definition of the objectId method from rental.js to index.js:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">Joi.objectId = require('joi-objectid')(Joi);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-127</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Now we load it once in index.js and then we can use it anywhere in our application. Don't
          forget to also add the code to load Joi:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const Joi = require('joi');</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-128</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We also need to modify models\movie.js. When creating a movie we need to pass a valid
          genreId so we replace the call to:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">genreId: Joi.string().required(),</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-129</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>with:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">genreId: Joi.objectId().required(),</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-130</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>One last change, before we finish this lecture, in our routes folder let's take a look at
          movies.js, specifically the route for creating a new movie:</p>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">router.post('/', async (req, res) =&gt; {
  const { error } = validate(req.body);
  if (error) return res.status(400).send(error.details[0].message);

  const genre = await Genre.findById(req.body.genreId);
  if (!genre) return res.status(400).send('Invalid genre.');

  let movie = new Movie({
    title: req.body.title,
    genre: {
      _id: genre._id,
      name: genre.name
    },
    numberInStock: req.body.numberInStock,
    dailyRentalRate: req.body.dailyRentalRate
  });

  movie = await movie.save(); res.send(movie);
});</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-131</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Here we create a new movie object:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">let movie = new Movie({</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-132</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Save it to the database:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">movie = await movie.save();</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-133</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Then return it:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">res.send(movie);</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-134</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In this implementation I am resetting the movie after saving it to the database. This was
          purely to demonstrate that this save method returns a movie document. Also, I didn't want
          to distract with too much detail about how objectId's work.</p>
        <p>Now that you know that objectId's are actually generated by MongoDB driver, not MongoDB
          database, you'll also know that when we create a new movie object Mongoose talks to
          MongoDB driver and set's the id right here:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">let movie = new Movie({</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-135</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Before saving this movie to the database. So technically we don't need to reset this
          movie:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">movie = await movie.save(); </code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-137</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>in order to return that id to the client. So we can remove that:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">await movie.save(); </code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-137</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>and change movie from a variable:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">let movie = new Movie({</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-138</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>to a constant:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const movie = new Movie({</code></pre>
          <figcaption>Fig 09-139</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The same principle applies when creating a new customer and a new genre.</p>
        <h3>123 - Recap</h3>
        <h4>Mongoose: Modelling Relationships between Connected Data</h4>
        <p>To model relationships between connected data, we can either reference a document or
          embed it in another document.</p>
        <p>When referencing a document, there is really no relationship between these two documents.
          So, it is possible to reference a non-existing document.</p>
        <p>Referencing documents (normalization) is a good approach when you want to enforce data
          consistency. Because there will be a single instance of an object in the database. But
          this approach has a negative impact on the performance of your queries because in MongoDB
          we cannot JOIN documents as we do in relational databases. So, to get a complete
          representation of a document with its related documents, we need to send multiple queries
          to the database.</p>
        <p>Embedding documents (denormalization) solves this issue. We can read a complete
          representation of a document with a single query. All the necessary data is embedded in
          one document and its children. But this also means we’ll have multiple copies of data in
          different places. While storage is not an issue these days, having multiple copies means
          changes made to the original document may not propagate to all copies. If the database
          server dies during an update, some documents will be inconsistent. For every business, for
          every problem, you need to ask this question: “can we tolerate data being inconsistent for
          a short period of time?” If not, you’ll have to use references. But again, this means that
          your queries will be slower.</p>

          their parent.</p>

        <p>We don’t have transactions in MongoDB. To implement transactions, we use a pattern called
          “Two Phase Commit”. If you don’t want to manually implement this pattern, use the Fawn NPM
          package:</p>
        <h4>Implementing transactions using Fawn</h4>
        <figure>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">try {
  await new Fawn.Task()
    .save(&lsquo;rentals&rsquo;, newRental)
    .update(&lsquo;movies&rsquo;, { _id: movie._id }, { $inc: numberInStock: -1 }})
    .run();
}
catch (ex) {
  // At this point, all operations are automatically rolled back
}</code></pre>

        <p>ObjectIDs are generated by MongoDB driver and are used to uniquely identify a document.
          They consist of 12 bytes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>4 bytes: timestamp</li>
          <li>3 bytes: machine identifier</li>
          <li>2 bytes: process identifier </li>
          <li>3 byes: counter</li>
        </ul>
        <p>ObjectIDs are almost unique. In theory, there is a chance for two ObjectIDs to be equal
          but the odds are very low (1/16,000,000) for most real-world applications.</p>
        // Validating ObjectIDs mongoose.Types.ObjectID.isValid(id); <p>To validate ObjectIDs using
        joi, use joi-objectid NPM package.</p>
